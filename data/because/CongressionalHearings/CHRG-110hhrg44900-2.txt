Mr. Bernanke:
 There were a number of recommendations in those reports I referred to. There are many steps that could be taken at the regulatory and supervisory level to strengthen the oversight of banks and other financial institutions. For example, I mentioned the Basel Accords which are strengthening liquidity requirements, changing capital charges for different kinds of activities, making recommendations to the regulators about how to go about strengthening the risk management systems of these firms.
    We are paying very close attention to the system as a whole. We are looking at the payment systems and other parts. The Federal Reserve has after all acted as a de facto--along with the Treasury--crisis manager for many decades. So there are a number of things we can do to strengthen the oversight under existing statutes and to make sure that the infrastructure is working as well as possible. For example, I mentioned also the private-public cooperation that we are now having to strengthen the OTC derivatives infrastructure and the like.
    So there's a lot that we can do, but we are doing--I just want to make very, very clear that what we are doing is, you know, working within the current statutory framework. The broader reforms that I believe are necessary are obviously the purview of Congress. And, you know, we hope that you'll be addressing those issues in a timely way.

Mr. Bachus:
 Secretary Paulson?

Secretary Paulson:
 I agree very much with what Chairman Bernanke has said, and I would just simply say that even if the structure isn't optimal and all of the authorities aren't optimal, regulators are working together seamlessly to address some of the issues that have arisen, and I think progress has been made.

Mr. Bachus:
 You know, one thing I have noticed, I know the President's Working Group, you know, as far back as say a year ago or I think as late as March, talked about the risk management practices of the investment banks as being faulty and that resulted in a lot of what we are seeing, market turmoil.
    I think the response I have seen from the Fed particularly has been that, you know, establishing risk management standards, which I certainly understand. You have also mentioned I think long term it's necessary to establish capital standards and liquidity standards. But short term, I do worry about new capital requirements and liquidity standards as sort of precipitating and sort of a tension between that and the need for these institutions to raise more capital. So how do you balance that?
    And I know one thing that you have talked about, I think the Treasury has talked about, is giving these--a lot of the banks the right to increase borrowing from or raising capital from private equity. Would you like to address that?

Secretary Paulson:
 Yes, Congressman. We have encouraged, both of our organizations have encouraged financial institutions to recognize losses and to raise capital, because capital is available, and that is a much better alternative than shrinking their balance sheets and pulling back from the activities that are so necessary.
    And as it relates to raising capital, private equity is one source, and we very much endorse the Fed's posture, which is being open to private equity investors and encouraging private equity investors.

Mr. Bernanke:
 Congressman, our first objective is to make sure that these firms are safe and able to withstand the current stresses. And so, for example, in our work with the SEC at the investment banks, we have urged them, and they have complied, in raising capital and especially in raising liquidity, which was one of the key issues with Bear Stearns. So we want them to be safe and we want to do that immediately.
    In the longer term, there is this issue of ``procyclicality,'' the possibility that capital rules and reserving rules and so on, accounting rules, will tend to exacerbate the credit cycle. It is a very important issue. We have some elements of the Basel II Accords that address that. But I think it's something that as we go forward, we will want to look at much harder to try to limit the regulatory impact on the procyclicality of credit.
    On private equity, I agree absolutely with the Secretary that we are looking for banks and other financial institutions to raise capital. Private equity is a very good source of capital. There are the issues relating to effective control as established by the Bank Holding Company Act, which has a statutory limit of 25 percent ownership. Below that, the Federal Reserve has to address what constitutes effective control. We are currently looking at that in the hope that we will make a clearer statement about when private equity can come in and add capital to the banking system.

Mr. Bachus:
 Thank you.

The Chairman:
 The gentleman from Pennsylvania.

Mr. Kanjorski:
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Paulson, Chairman Bernanke, listening to your response to the chairman about timing, since last August of course all of us have examined and watched market failure occurring in various and sundry areas growing from subprime failure in August to what we call now a credit crisis. And the information that I am receiving from some entities is that the end is not here; there are other shoes to fall.
    And what occurs to me is that this gap we are talking about between now and when the new Congress convenes it could pass the emergency powers or extraordinary powers or change powers that are necessary to meet this crisis. It is probably for all intents and purposes 9 months at least.
    In the meantime, between now and March or April of next year, what type of anticipated problems could we be dealing with or could you be dealing with and the American economy be dealing with that we should take cognizance of now? And is there perhaps a need for extraordinary emergency legislation to empower either the Federal Reserve or Treasury to take certain actions to prevent systemic risk if over the next 9-month period the Congress is not able to act and you discern that the powers you have are not adequate to meet the challenges? That hiatus seems to me to be one that we have to address now.
    Mr. Secretary?

Secretary Paulson:
 Let me say that I have grown up in a world where you don't always have all the tools you'd like to have, and I have very seldom seen a perfect hand that someone has to play. We are dealing in a financial market that has evolved greatly since the time that many of our rules were put in place, that many of the--that the regulatory structure was set. And so, realistically, I agree with the Chairman, that it will be difficult to get it done as quickly as we would like.
    The resolution powers for a large financial institution that is not a bank, it would be nice to be able to have that. But I will again say to you, even though this is a difficult period we are going through, and we both said that it's going to take some time to get through it, there will be some more bumps on the road, I really want to emphasize that you have seen the Federal Reserve, by opening up the discount window to the investment banks, through the Bear Stearns actions, to make a very strong statement about the importance of the stability of our financial system. And I have seen those investment banks working with the Fed and the SEC to strengthen their liquidity, strengthen their capital positions, and re-price risk. So we are making progress here.
    And, you know, I get reports all the time. Our regulators are very vigilant. I received a report about the banking industry and get it regularly. As of the end of March, even though the banks are going through some difficult problems, and their situation is evolving, the reports I got indicated that 99 percent of those institutions holding 99 percent of the assets fell into the highest capital category, well capitalized. So we are making progress. We don't have everything we would like to have, but I think the right answer to our question, Congressman, which is a good question, is we have to--we always have to have contingency plans, be prepared for various eventualities. We plan, we work together. We have been doing that from before the turmoil started, from the day I set foot in Washington. And we are just going to have to work together, be creative and work with you.

Mr. Kanjorski:
 Mr. Secretary, my time is running out. This morning I spoke to a student loan group, and we worked for the last 4 or 5 months to try and resolve that pressing problem, the failure of the auction market. And even what I received from them is that sometimes the activities or willingness of our Departments, like the Department of Education and even your Department, are unwilling to take the risk of implying the authority to do things.
    I am just urging, either you recognize that now, and if you need emergency powers on some of these things you mentioned to us before we get to catastrophe.

Secretary Paulson:
 Well, let me mention the student loans, because here is a case where I think you have seen our department work creatively with the Department of Education to deal with a problem that's here and now, and so we have a program in place which I think is going to be acceptable to most fellow lenders. I think it's going to work. To the extent that we need something else, the Department of Education is ready with their direct lending, their lending of last resort. Meanwhile, we are working creatively at Treasury to come up with other market-based solutions to help this market.
    So we are working through this. We have a program that's going to get us through this period, and we are working to do things to help that securitization market become more vital.

The Chairman:
 The gentleman from Delaware.

Mr. Castle:
 Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. To the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and to Secretary Paulson, I would just like to thank them I think for what has been excellent work in very difficult circumstances, as well as the chairman and the ranking member of the committee.
    My questions, I guess, are going to be more about timing than anything. We see the expressions ``short term,'' ``intermediate term,'' ``long term,'' expressions like that. I guess when you're--we all look at our calendars differently. When you're in Congress, you sort of think in terms of the next election or whatever it may be. We have a couple of more weeks in July. We have September, and then we have the election season coming up. And, Secretary Paulson, you mentioned that the financial institutions need to recognize their losses and raise capital, those kinds of things.
    But my question to you regarding the fluctuations in the various equity markets around the world, plus the housing market in the United States is this: Is the short term measurable, in a matter of months or whatever it may be, not years at this point?
    Furthermore, is there anything that we in Congress should be doing in the short time we have left that would be helpful with respect to the problems that exist right now in America? Is there anything--and you probably have identified this in your testimony, but I must admit it's complicated enough for me to have trouble following. Are there things that you all should be doing on a short-term basis that would be helpful that we should know about?

Secretary Paulson:
 Well, let me mention a couple of things right away. First of all, your committee has been out in front on this, but let's get the GSE reform legislation done, to have a strong, independent regulator that will inject confidence into those institutions and into the markets, and that's a very positive thing.
    And then secondly, we both haven't said don't work on this. I mean, work should begin immediately and urgently on these resolution authorities and these steps we have suggested. We are just telling you that realistically, because we have heard from you, and we know it to be the case, realistically, it's going to be difficult to get things done this year. But this is going to take some time, so begin work urgently on that. But those are the two things that I would suggest.

Mr. Castle:
 Chairman Bernanke?

Mr. Bernanke:
 Like Secretary Paulson, I have no objection whatsoever to early action and will continue to work with you closely in all directions. It's just our sense, and of course you're in a better place than we are to make the judgment, that the more complex issues like resolution or even financial regulatory restructuring are simply not likely to happen in a short term, and we need to take the time to make sure it's done right and thoroughly worked through.
    So we will continue to think about what steps might be taken on a shorter-term basis and be in close touch with Congress. But, again, we are--I just want to be clear that, you know, it's not that we don't have any tools. We have plenty of tools, and we are working together very well I think to address a difficult situation.

Mr. Castle:
 Well, I would agree with you. I think probably everyone in this room would agree with you on GSE reform. I hope you will carry that same message to the Senate, too. We think that is vitally important. And I would agree with you that we do need to work on some of these regulatory systems. But can you give me some sense of what you think the timing may be? I don't see that happening this year, either in Congress or by outside regulatory procedures. But do you have some sense of what the timing may be on the centralizing of regulation as encapsulated in what you have been stating? Is this something you would expect to happen next year, or would it take 3 to 5 years to do this?

Secretary Paulson:
 Well, yes. I think maybe I should have even been clearer on this. In terms of--when we started thinking about regulatory structure, we began the thinking before this period of market turmoil, well before this. And we started off saying, if we were beginning from scratch, which we obviously aren't, how would you design a system? And that was more of a vision to start a discussion. And to me, to get to there, as the Chairman said, would take a good while. We are talking about multiple years. But if you don't know which way you would like to head, you know, you have no chance of getting there.
    So we started with that vision, and then we came up with some immediate priorities and some other things that could be done in the intermediate term. And as I look at what can be done in terms of the timing the one thing we are not talking about a lot here, but I do believe we don't want to forget, is the fact that a lot of this problem came about as a result of sloppy and lax mortgage origination procedures. These mortgages were originated, most--many cases at the State level with State regulation and supervision. We weren't proposing doing away with this, but a mortgage origination commission to set standards at the Federal level and evaluate what's going on, you know, at the States, I think is something you shouldn't lose sight of.
    And then the things we have talked about here that can be done quickly are the resolution authorities for complex financial institutions that aren't federally insured, giving the Federal Reserve authority and responsibility over the payment systems, which can be done very quickly; moving to have the Fed while retaining their responsibilities as a consolidated regulator, to give them the authorities they need to do the macro stability job, can be done.
    And then, looking out a little bit further, there is no doubt that we should have a merger, in my mind, with the SEC and the CFTC. And so that again is something that can be done in the intermediate term, as could an optional Federal charter for insurance.

The Chairman:
 The gentlewoman from California.
    Ms. Waters. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank you first for holding this very important hearing today, and I would like to thank both Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke for being here today.
    Let me start by saying that which you have probably heard too often, how disappointed I am with all of us, Members of Congress, for what appears to have been weak oversight of our regulatory agencies, and our regulatory agencies for what appears to have been weak oversight of our financial institutions.
    I have to tell you, I have been holding hearings throughout the country on the subprime meltdown, and I'm absolutely stunned by the extent of the devastation to some of our families and communities caused by this subprime meltdown. I'm stunned when I hear about these exotic products and how they could ever have come into being without any oversight.
    I'm really stunned about some of the ARMs and the way that they reset, and the fact that there's something called a margin that I never knew about before, and that margin can be whatever the financial institution decides it should be, above and beyond the going interest rate.
    I came on this committee right after the S&L scandal, and I heard a lot about reform. And so while I suppose I should be impressed with the fact that there's a President's Working Group on Financial Markets and the reports that have been issued, I'm skeptical about what is being proposed. As it said in March, the President's Working Group on Financial Markets issued a report and recommendations for addressing the weaknesses revealed by recent events, both at the international level--between the two reports--and at the domestic level, between the two reports, focused on a number of specific problems, including mortgage lending practices and their oversight, risk management and management at large financial institutions.
    And then there was, Mr. Bernanke, the Blueprint that you talked about for a modernized financial regulatory structure, and you proposed a new regulatory architecture, and the third regulatory agency would be focused on protecting consumers and investors. I have to tell you, I'm surprised, because I thought that our regulatory agencies, no matter how they were organized, whether it was by financial institution category or not, had as its prime objective, all of those things that you talk about doing now.
    So what I really want to know is not so much what you plan that may not be instituted for some time, because it takes some time to get this into practice, I want to know what you're doing now. I want to know what you know about servicers. We have found that there's little if any regulation of mortgage servicers.
    And I want to know if you have anything in your plans to deal with them, because after we get finished with all of the President's HOPE NOW program and the money that we are giving to NeighborWorks and other organizations to do counseling, they can't do very much good, because the servicers are the ones who make the decisions.
    They're the ones that are in charge of these accounts. They decide to collect--well, they have to collect the fees, they have to collect the mortgage payment. They increase fees. They agree to extend or modify arrangement, but they can do practically whatever they want. I want to know what you know about them, what you're doing about them.
    And secondly, I want to know and understand Mr. Bernanke, what you know about the sale of Countrywide to Bank of America. I understand that Bank of America bought these mortgages at quite a reduced rate. And I want to know what that rate was and whether or not these properties could go back on the market appraised at a higher rate than the bank purchased them for, and who gets the profit and the difference, and why can't that go back to the homeowners who are losing their homes through foreclosure. First, I would like to hear from Secretary Paulson.

Secretary Paulson:
 Well, first of all, I understand your frustration, and I understand what's going on right now in the marketplace, how it's affecting homeowners, and I feel your frustration and I understand it.
    Now--
    Ms. Waters. Mortgage servicers.

Secretary Paulson:
 In terms of market servicers, the HOPE NOW Alliance is, I believe, making a big difference and making a difference every single month. It is helping 200,000 people a month. And it is getting to those people, and as far as I can see, Congresswoman Waters, and I look at this data all the time, and the standard I use is this: Are there people who can afford to stay in their homes, who want to stay in their homes but are being forced into foreclosure?
    Very sadly, there have been people who have been put in homes who didn't have the ability to stay in the homes and to afford to stay in the homes, and there are others who were speculators and walked away from mortgages. So what we have done, this HOPE NOW Alliance is again focused on getting to people and making a difference. And I think the servicers are making a difference.
    Ms. Waters. I'm sorry. I really do need to ask a question about mortgage servicers.

The Chairman:
 We can't ask another question. We are over time. We have a time problem. Mr. Chairman, do you want to answer?

Mr. Bernanke:
 I would like to briefly answer, yes. I said a few things. On consumer protection, about a year ago I testified before this committee and said that the Federal Reserve was going to take significant action on protection for high-cost loans. On Monday we will announce the final rules, and I think they will be very effective in addressing some of these issues.
    Admittedly, it would be better if it had been earlier, but we have responded and you'll soon see the proposal or the rules that we are going to be issuing with respect to consumer protection. We are also of course working on rules with respect to credit cards as well.
    On foreclosure avoidance, again, HOPE NOW has been taking a leadership role. The Federal Reserve has been supporting that in various ways, including urging banks to work with customers in trouble and through a variety of neighborhood activities through our reserve banks around the country, which I would be happy to provide more information about.
    And finally, on Countrywide, of course that was a market transaction. The Fed had nothing to do with it, and the discounts related to the probability that some of those loans would go into default. I do think that in a sense some of those savings ought to pass through to the ultimate borrowers. And in a sense, when there's a principal writedown or other loan modification that is essentially what is happening, that you're giving a break to the borrower so the borrower can stay in the home, and I think that's a good thing to do.

The Chairman:
 Let me ask, Mr. Secretary, that you respond in writing, particularly because of our time constraints, on the servicer issue.

Secretary Paulson:
 Yes, I look forward to doing that.

The Chairman:
 So I would ask that you respond in writing to the servicer part of the question. The gentleman from California.

Mr. Royce:
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you, Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke, for being with us, and I want to begin with a question to Secretary Paulson. And Chairman Bernanke, you might want to comment on this, too.
    There was a speech delivered by the Federal Reserve Chairman, former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago in May of 2005. And he said, ``Market participants usually have strong incentives to monitor and control the risks they assume in choosing to deal with particular counterparties. In essence, prudential regulation is supplied by the market through counterparty evaluation and monitoring rather than by the authorities. Such private prudential regulation can be impaired, indeed even displaced,'' said Greenspan, ``if some counterparties assume that government regulators obviate private prudence. We regulators are often perceived as constraining excessive risk-taking more effectively than is demonstrably possible in practice, except where market discipline is undermined by moral hazard, for example, because of federal guarantees of private debt, private regulation generally has proved far better at constraining excessive risk taking than has government regulation.''
    And more recently, Jeffrey Lacker, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, and he said--he got into details about the need for regulators to distinguish between fundamental and nonfundamental runs on financial institutions when considering intervention by the regulators. And he said, ``There are models in which runs are self-fulfilling prophesies, are costly, and could be avoided perhaps through central bank intervention. Other runs arise from fundamental developments, and for these, central bank intervention interference with market discipline distorts market prices.''
    And so I would ask you both if it is possible to establish a regulatory model that can provide a sense of security to prevent self-fulfilling prophesies, to use, you know, Jeffrey Lacker's words, with respect to runs on our financial institutions, and at the same time avoid interfering with the type of market discipline that Mr. Greenspan believes is so critical to the health of our capital markets.
    And if I could start with you, Secretary Paulson.

Secretary Paulson:
 I believe that is really the trick. That's what needs to be done, to have the right balance between market stability, you know, the regulatory piece, and market discipline. That is critical. And a well-balanced, healthy system over time is going to need that.
    And what I have said, and what I tried to say today is that right now we are going through a period of unusual turmoil. The focus on all of our parts is on market stability. That's what the focus is. But our system will never be what it should be unless we can get to the point where market discipline plays its necessary role. And in order to get there, I want to emphasize what Ben Bernanke said.
    We need to do some things to strengthen the infrastructure we have, the over-the-counter derivative market, the tri-party repossession market, and that which is secured financing between institutions, and we need to do that so that the appearance and the reality that institutions are too interconnected to fail no longer exists, and we are going to need broader emergency authorities for the resolution or wind-down of complex financial institutions that don't have Federal deposit insurance.
    But that's where we need to get. That is what we have to drive toward, but let's not forget today our institutions have been doing the things they need to do, shoring up their liquidity, their capital, and our emphasis is on stability today.

Mr. Royce:
 Thank you, Secretary Paulson. Chairman Bernanke, if you could respond.

Mr. Bernanke:
 I would like to. Thank you. First of all, I agree absolutely that market discipline is the heart of our system. Avoiding the moral hazard, having strong market discipline makes the system work better, and an example would be the counterparty discipline between the banks, investment banks, and the hedge funds, has protected the banks and the banks and the investment banks from any losses from hedge funds. There have been no material losses to banks or investment banks because of failing hedge funds, and because the banks have been doing due diligence, and that's what we want to see.
    Now in my view, our action to address the Bear Stearns situation was necessary, given the financial conditions at the time, but it's absolutely correct, as President Lacker has pointed out, it does raise moral hazard concerns going forward, and then the question is how do you address those.
    In my remarks today, I listed three possible approaches or complementary approaches. The first is supervisory oversight of those institutions to make sure that they are in fact doing what they need to do to be safe and sound, are not taking advantage of the implicit backstop. So since we have gone into the investment banks, they have all raised their liquidity, not reduced it. So that is one way to ensure that the moral hazard is minimized.
    Second, as Secretary Paulson mentioned, if we can strengthen our infrastructure sufficiently so that it could absorb the failure of a large firm--we felt it wasn't able to do so in March. But if it were clearer that the system could withstand the failure of a firm of Bear Stearns' size, then we would be much more comfortable letting it happen, because we would think the system would be preserved.
    And finally, I think that, as has happened in the commercial banking world, we do have stronger resolution procedures that would allow us to intervene in an early stage perhaps and to try to create an orderly process that doesn't create the market externalities at the same time it would avoid moral hazard because the equity holders, the management and subordinate debt holders would all be subjected to losses in that process.

The Chairman:
 The gentleman from Alabama had a unanimous consent request.

Mr. Bachus:
 Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask for unanimous consent to submit for the record Secretary Paulson's speech in London on July 2nd on market discipline.

The Chairman:
 Without objection, the speech will be made a part of the record, and the gentlewoman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes.

Mrs. Maloney:
 Welcome, and thank you for your service. I want to give a very special welcome to Secretary Paulson who previously was a business and civic leader in the great City of New York, and it is reassuring to me and many Americans that someone who has deep experience in the day-to-day operation of financial markets is at the helm of Treasury and really initiating this conversation and discussion today.
    I also want to welcome Chairman Bernanke, who has brought the Fed to fully realize its role, not only managing monetary policy and guarding the safety and soundness of our financial institutions, but also focusing on curbing unfair and deceptive practices that have hurt working Americans and our overall economy. Next week we look forward and congratulate you on your new regulations to shore up mortgage lending, and I enthusiastically support your proposed role to eliminate abusive practices in credit cards.
    I would like to follow up on my colleague's questioning on market discipline and ask Secretary Paulson, who has a great deal of experience in this area. It's clear from recent events that many expected synergies of financial service activities, whatever benefits that they gave during times of economic prosperity, gave rise to conflicts and excessive risk taking. It appears that many firms are in so many lines of businesses that conflicts and excessive risk arise.
    Huge trading operations have also put more mundane activities of financial institutions at risk. For example, some have said Bear Stearns' trading operation may have caused risk to its clearing operations. And in view of these recent events and challenges, some have said that the repeal and deregulation of Glass-Steagal may have gone too far.
    And I would like to ask, would a financial service industry where banks, hedge funds, investment banks, and other entities were more limited to the array of business they are in help the situation by providing competitive and arm's-length checks and balances on financial activities through the marketplace? And would a more diversified financial service industry that had more specialization and less concentration offer any benefits in reducing risk and the need for regulation?

Secretary Paulson:
 Congresswoman Maloney, that's an important question. There is no doubt that our financial system has grown. It has become much more complex. We have seen a complexity of financial instruments, and a lot has taken place between the last stress we had in the market in 1998 and this current period. And so we are seeing how a number of these institutions and securities are performing under stress for the first time.
    I do agree with you that large, complex financial institutions are difficult to manage. So I agree with you there. I would also say, though, that a lot of the diversity in our financial system, and Chairman Bernanke commented about it, you know, the so-called hedge funds where people were saying is that going to be a major problem? And yet those risks, so far we have managed through those pretty well.
    I believe that the biggest problems we are dealing with is not the diversification of these organizations but it is the amount of risk that was taken on, and the amount of leverage, much greater than was understood, because a lot of it was taken on through complex products that were difficult to understand. And that's why it's taking so long to work through this.
    So I believe the big part of the answer here is going to be the de-leveraging and going forward enhancing liquidity practices, risk management practices, and getting our arms around some of these complex products.

Mrs. Maloney:
 Thank you. My time has expired. Unless you would like to--

The Chairman:
 You cut yourself off, but did you want a response from the Chairman?

Mrs. Maloney:
 Absolutely, if time permits. If time permits, Mr. Chairman.

The Chairman:
 Well, the rule is that no member can ask questions after their 5 minutes is up, but if there is a question pending, we will take it.

Mr. Bernanke:
 Just very quickly, Congresswoman. I think Gramm-Leach-Bliley has some definite positives in terms of diversification, complementary services and the like has created very, very big firms. One of the things that the various reports from the PWG and the FSF have highlighted is that firms did not do a good enough job of firmwide risk management. They looked at individual business lines and not the firm as a whole. That's a critical step for them to be doing. We are encouraging that. And we are also trying to do a better job of our consolidated supervision whereby we focus not just on the holding company but we make sure that we interact more intensively with the functional regulators of the subsidiaries or the affiliates.
    So I don't think the system is broken, but it does need some improvement in execution.

Mrs. Maloney:
 Thank you very much.

The Chairman:
 The gentleman from Texas.
    Dr. Paul. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And welcome, Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke. I'm delighted the two of you are here today because I might just get to the bottom of the question I have been asking for many years, which is, who is in charge of the dollar? Because sometimes when I ask the Fed, I get referred to the Treasury and vice versa, but maybe I can get a better answer today.
    I do want to acknowledge the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Garrett, for playing a part in bringing these hearings about, and also Chairman Frank for having these hearings because I deeply appreciate it.
    But I would like to take a minute to just challenge something he said during his questioning, because he made the flat statement that there was no alternative to the Federal Reserve system. I don't want to take my time to explain the alternative, but maybe later on, Chairman Frank and I can talk and I can explain to him what an alternative might be.

The Chairman:
 That's not very likely.
    [Laughter]
    Dr. Paul. But anyway, I would like to pursue the theme of the day, and that has to do with systemic risk. And there's a lot of talk about systemic risk and also taken in the context of market discipline. But, you know--and we are talking so much about more regulations. And quite frankly, I think we should have a lot more regulations, but I think we should have market regulations.
    I would like to see a lot more regulations on the government and on the Federal Reserve, because I think it's the ability of the government, through regulatory agencies as well as the Federal Reserve, to disrupt markets and destroy market discipline. That is where I think our problem lies.
    When Enron failed, we immediately said, well, it must have happened because we didn't have enough regulation, so Congress immediately responded by passing Sarbanes-Oxley. It hasn't exactly helped our markets. You know, our markets today, almost every index of the market today is where it was 8 to 9 years ago, and that's not taking into consideration inflation, the devaluation of the dollar. So the markets are in severe trouble. They are very dysfunctional.
    But the real question is, why are they in such disarray? And of course I maintain that they're in disarray because our monetary policy disrupts the markets because we create interest rates below market rates. Right now the money is free to the banks. They can borrow money at 2 percent. Real inflation is 10 or 12 percent.
    And we wonder why there are disruptions when you have artificially low interest rates, you cause the malinvestment, you cause excessive debt to accumulate, and you cause the bubbles to burst. And then when they burst, the only thing we can come back for is more regulations and more inflation, we need lower interest rates, we need to print more money.
    But it is back to this basic fundamental problem that we think that we can compensate for lack of savings by creating money out of thin air, and it doesn't work. It has never worked throughout history, it's not going to work this time, and we can't bail ourselves out by more regulations and more monetary inflation. And that is where we are today.
    I think the IMF is correct in this circumstance. They say we are in worse shape than since the Depression. And yet our government tells us there's not even a recession. This is utterly amazing. Ask the American people. Our government tells us inflation is 4 percent. Nobody believes that. I mean, just look at the cost of energy. So we have to someday get back to the fundamentals of what is a dollar, where do they come from, and who's in charge of the dollar.
    So my question is directed to Secretary Paulson dealing with the dollar, because evidently he is the spokesman and he is the champion of the dollar, and all public statements are that the dollar is to be strong. Well, the dollar lost 20 percent in the last 2 years. In the last 3 years, we have created $4 trillion of new dollars. But when we go to China, we tell the Chinese we want a weak dollar.
    I would like to see if I can get the Secretary of the Treasury to explain this to me. Do we want a weak dollar or a strong dollar, and why don't we worry about the value of our dollar?
