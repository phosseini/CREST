Transcriptome Analysis of the Brucella abortus BvrR/BvrS Two-Component Regulatory System 
Background The two-component BvrR/BvrS system is essential for Brucella abortus virulence.
It was shown previously that its dysfunction alters the expression of some major outer membrane proteins and the pattern of lipid A acylation.
To determine the genes regulated by BvrR/BvrS, we performed a whole-genome microarray analysis using B. abortus RNA obtained from wild type and bvrR mutant cells grown in the same conditions.
Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 127 differentially expressed genes were found: 83 were over expressed and 44 were less expressed in the bvrR mutant.
Two operons, the phosphotransferase system and the maltose transport system, were down-regulated.
Several genes involved in cell envelope or outer membrane biogenesis were differentially expressed: genes for outer membrane proteins (omp25a, omp25d), lipoproteins, LPS and fatty acid biosynthesis, stress response proteins, chaperones, flagellar genes, and twelve genes encoding ABC transport systems.
Ten genes related with carbon metabolism (pckA and fumB among others) were up-regulated in the bvrR mutant, and denitrification genes (nirK, norC and nosZ) were also regulated.
Notably, seven transcriptional regulators were affected, including VjbR, ExoR and OmpR that were less expressed in the bvrR mutant.
Finally, the expression of eleven genes which have been previously related with Brucella virulence was also altered.
Conclusions/Significance All these data corroborate the impact of BvrR/BvrS on cell envelope modulation, confirm that this system controls the carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and suggest a cross-talk among some regulators to adjust the Brucella physiology to the shift expected to occur during the transit from the extracellular to the intracellular niche.
