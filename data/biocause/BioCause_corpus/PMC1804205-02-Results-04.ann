T51	Causality 252 273	This could be because
E12	Causality:T51 Effect:T52 Evidence:T53
T52	Span 138 250	The results described above established that PmrB is required for activation of PmrA in response to mild acid pH
T54	Causality 682 704	Thus, we reasoned that
E13	Causality:T54 Evidence:T56 Effect:T55
T55	Span 705 840	if PmrB senses extracytoplasmic pH directly, its periplasmic domain (Fig. 5A) was likely to be required for the response to this signal
T56	Span 514 645	PmrB is required for the activation of PmrA-regulated genes in response to the low Mg2+ signal, which is sensed by the PhoQ protein
T57	Span 2089 2228	While this mutation severely diminished the ability of Salmonella to respond to mild acid pH, there still was some residual pbgP expression
T58	Causality 2239 2254	suggesting that
E14	Causality:T58 Effect:T59 Evidence:T57
T59	Span 2255 2307	other residues might also be required for pH sensing
T60	Causality 1328 1386	Together, these results argue in favour of the notion that
E15	Causality:T60 Effect:T62 Evidence:T61
T61	Span 1145 1316	There was no pbgP expression in cells grown at pH 5.8 (Fig. 5B) or in the presence of Fe3+ (Fig. 5D), which is in contrast to the normal activation in response to low Mg2+
T62	Span 1387 1470	PmrB senses extracellular pH besides its previously described ligands Fe3+ and Al3+
T63	Causality 3685 3700	indicating that
E16	Causality:T63 Effect:T64 Evidence:T65
T64	Span 3701 3839	mutations in residues of the periplasmic domain of PmrB do not impair the enzymatic activity of the cytoplasmic domain of the PmrB protein
T65	Span 3545 3651	Strains expressing the mutant PmrB proteins could express pbgP normally in response to the low Mg2+ signal
T53	Span 274 381	PmrB is directly involved in sensing extracytoplasmic pH in a way analogous to its sensing of Fe3+ and Al3+
T66	Span 405 503	or because PmrB plays an indirect role in its capacity of main (if not sole) phosphodonor for PmrA
