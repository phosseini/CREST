T31	Span 193 322	BfiS (PA4197), BfmR (PA4101) and MifR (PA5511) are essential in the stage-specific development of P. aeruginosa biofilm formation
T32	Span 1147 1289	Loss of bfiS, bfmR, and mifR expression due to arabinose removal resulted in the collapse of the mutant biofilm architecture within three days
T34	Span 1429 1599	he collapse was apparent by significant reduction (P<0.05) of biofilm variables including biofilm biomass and thickness, which further decreased upon continued incubation
T35	Causality 1886 1915	These findings indicated that

T33	Span 1619 1775	Post 144 hr of arabinose removal, the biofilm architecture of the complemented mutants was similar to mutant biofilms lacking the respective regulatory gene
T36	Span 1916 2079	the three novel regulators are not only essential for the stage-specific progression of P. aeruginosa biofilms but also in the maintenance of the biofilm structure
