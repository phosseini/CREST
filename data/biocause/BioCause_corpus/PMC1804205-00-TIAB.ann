T27	Span 405 598	Growth in mild acid (pH 5.8) promotes transcription of genes activated by the response regulator PmrA, but the signalling pathway(s) that mediates this response has thus far remained unexplored
T28	Causality 605 614	we report
E3	Causality:T28 Effect:T27 Cause:T29
T29	Span 615 790	that this activation requires both PmrA's cognate sensor kinase PmrB, which had been previously shown to respond to Fe3+ and Al3+, and PmrA's post-translational activator PmrD
T30	Fact 792 921	Substitution of a conserved histidine or of either one of four conserved glutamic acid residues in the periplasmic domain of PmrB
T31	Fact 922 1014	severely decreased or abolished the mild acid-promoted transcription of PmrA-activated genes

T33	Span 1016 1129	The PmrA/PmrB system controls lipopolysaccharide modifications mediating resistance to the antibiotic polymyxin B
T34	Span 1131 1248	Wild-type Salmonella grown at pH 5.8 were > 100 000-fold more resistant to polymyxin B than organisms grown at pH 7.7
T35	Causality 1250 1274	Our results suggest that
E5	Causality:T35 Effect:T36 Evidence:T34
T36	Span 1275 1465	protonation of the PmrB periplasmic histidine and/or of the glutamic acid residues activate the PmrA protein, and that mild acid promotes cellular changes resulting in polymyxin B resistance
