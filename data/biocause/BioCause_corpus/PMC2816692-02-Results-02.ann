T33	Span 158 356	In comparative genomics analyses, srcA was found in all virulent strains of Salmonella enterica containing SPI-2, but was absent from the cold-blooded animal commensal, S. bongori, which lacks SPI-2
T34	Causality 369 383	This suggested
E7	Causality:T34 Effect:T35 Evidence:T33
T35	Span 384 465	a co-evolution of srcA with the SPI-2 T3SS and a possible functional relationship
T36	Span 474 536	we reasoned that SrcA should contribute to animal colonization
T37	Causality 537 544	because
E8	Causality:T37 Evidence:T38 Effect:T36
T38	Span 545 591	the SPI-2 T3SS is essential for host infection
T39	Span 816 1012	After three days of infection the geometric mean competitive index (CI) for the mutant was 0.20 (95%CI 0.13-0.29) and 0.18 (95%CI 0.06-0.5) in the spleen and liver respectively (P<0.0001; Fig. 1D)
T40	Causality 1013 1028	indicating that
E9	Causality:T40 Effect:T41 Evidence:T39
T41	Span 1029 1127	bacteria lacking srcA were significantly out competed by wild type cells during systemic infection
T42	Span 1343 1446	The level of attenuation of the srcA mutant was generally higher than most single effector gene mutants
T43	Causality 1453 1479	which suggested to us that
E10	Causality:T43 Effect:T44 Evidence:T42
T44	Span 1480 1544	SrcA contributes to an important aspect of T3SS function in vivo
