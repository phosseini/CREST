T58	Span 1012 1070	low G+C base content compared to the genome average of 52%
T59	Span 1072 1317	it's likely that srcA (32% G+C) and an adjacent gene, STM2137 (37% G+C), were acquired as a foreign islet that was retained in organisms containing the SPI-2 T3SS due to the selective advantage afforded by the new protein interactions so created
T60	Span 1928 2153	For example, InvB and SicP (Salmonella SPI-1), CesT (enteropathogenic E. coli locus of enterocyte effacement) and Spa15 (Shigella mxi/spa virulence plasmid region) chaperones are all encoded within the T3SS structural operons
