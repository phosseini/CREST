T30	Fact 1128 1234	SL1344 killed 42% of the macrophages, whereas SR1304 killed only 16% of the macrophages 4h after infection

T33	Span 1816 1877	the main target of Mlc action in Salmonella virulence is SPI1
T34	Span 1617 1761	When the number of intracellular bacteria were measured at 2 and 18h post-infection, the degree of replication was similar for SL1344 and SR1304
