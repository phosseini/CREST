T60	Span 697 789	Streptolysin O is a cytotoxin that damages human tissue and increases host cell cytotoxicity
T61	Span 798 958	The resulting cellular damage, particularly to polymorphonuclear leukocytes [26], decreases internalization and subsequent intracellular killing of streptococci
T62	Causality 798 798	
E27	Causality:T62 Evidence:T60 Effect:T61
T63	Causality 1011 1024	we infer that
E28	Causality:T63 Evidence:T64 Effect:T65
T64	Span 965 1009	Based on its downregulation during adherence
T65	Span 1025 1168	slo was transcribed during pre-adherence associations, perhaps, as previously reported, to protect streptococci from phagocytic killing in vivo
T66	Causality 1198 1219	our data suggest that
E29	Causality:T66 Evidence:T67 Effect:T68
T67	Span 1175 1196	However, once adhered
T68	Span 1220 1365	streptococci downregulate production of this cytotoxin, presumably to prevent further host tissue destruction that could interfere with adherence
T69	Span 1734 1835	When SpeB expression is limited, several streptococcal proteins necessary for adherence remain intact
T70	Causality 1848 1852	thus
E30	Causality:T70 Evidence:T69 Effect:T71
T71	Span 1854 1939	decreased SpeB production (as indicated here) may promote pharyngeal cell attachment.
T72	Span 1940 2088	Furthermore, SpeB abolishes internalization (following adherence) of certain streptococcal strains by epithelial cells (including Detroit 562 cells)
T73	Span 2090 2153	a process mediated in part by the fibronectin-binding protein F
T74	Causality 2090 2090	
E31	Causality:T74 Effect:T72 Evidence:T73
T75	Span 2163 2331	We observed significant upregulation of the gene spy0130, encoding a protein recently found to be associated with the production of surface-exposed pili on strain SF370
T76	Span 2338 2393	The protein shares 60% sequence similarity to protein F
T77	Causality 2395 2410	suggesting that
E32	Causality:T77 Effect:T78 Evidence:T75
T78	Span 2411 2505	it may coordinate a similar internalization mechanism or may be involved directly in adherence
E33	Causality:T77 Effect:T78 Evidence:T76
T79	Span 2755 2859	Taken together, our results agree with previous reports on SpeB production during host cell interactions
T80	Causality 2861 2876	suggesting that
E34	Causality:T80 Evidence:T79 Effect:T81
T81	Span 2877 3107	decreased expression may promote streptococcal adherence (by preventing proteolytic degradation of key virulence factors or adhesins), enhance internalization (perhaps through a fibronectin-mediated pathway), and increase survival
