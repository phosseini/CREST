T47	Span 1343 1496	In wild type cells, promoter activity from all the transcriptional fusions was high, as expected, because LPM medium is highly inducing for SsrB activity
T48	Span 1503 1751	In contrast, promoter activity for sseA, ssaB, and sifA decreased in the rpoE mutant compared to wild type cells (Figure 2A, B and 2D), whereas promoter activity from the ssaG and srfN reporters was upregulated in the rpoE mutant (Figure 2C and 2F)
T49	Span 1753 1895	beta-galactosidase activity observed from the sseL reporter was unaltered in the rpoE deletion compared to that in wild type cells (Figure 2E)
