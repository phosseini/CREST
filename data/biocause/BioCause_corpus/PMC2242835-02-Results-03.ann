T25	Span 972 1116	complementation of H37Ra with the phoP wild-type copy partially restored its virulence, but not to the extent of the fully virulent H37Rv strain
T26	Span 690 929	Whereas H37Ra::fadE5 (Figure 1) and H37Ra::rpsL (unpublished data) showed very little or no growth over the 7-d period, the H37Ra::phoP mutant grew more vigorously, with a 7.5-fold increase in colony-forming units (CFU) over the 7-d period
T27	Span 582 688	When H37Ra knock-ins were tested, important differences in their ex vivo growth characteristics were found
