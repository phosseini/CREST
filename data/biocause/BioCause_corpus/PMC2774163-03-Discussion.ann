T184	Causality 124 154	has led to the assumption that
E28	Causality:T184 Evidence:T185 Effect:T186
T185	Span 34 123	biofilm development is a coordinated series of events coinciding with distinct phenotypes
T186	Span 155 207	the formation of biofilms is a regulated progression
T187	Span 233 457	biofilm development has been considered to be distinct from other developmental processes including the programmed differentiation seen in spore formation in Bacillus subtilis or fruiting body formation in Myxococcus xanthus
T188	Causality 464 478	mainly because
E29	Causality:T188 Effect:T189 Evidence:T187
T189	Span 479 640	no regulatory pathways have yet been identified that are responsible for regulating committed steps in the formation of biofilms with the exception of attachment
T190	Span 1382 1544	The stage-specific arrest in biofilm formation of the mutant strains coincided with the timing of phosphorylation of the respective regulatory or sensory proteins
T191	Causality 1545 1560	indicating that
E30	Causality:T191 Effect:T192 Evidence:T190
T192	Span 1561 1711	the phosphorylation status of the three novel two-component systems is essential for their function in regulating biofilm development by P. aeruginosa
T193	Span 2349 2561	While it is not clear how the three two-component systems interact to form the observed sequential phosphorylation cascade, it is apparent from our observations that phosphorylation of each of the three novel TCS
T194	Causality 2562 2574	has to occur
E31	Causality:T194 Effect:T195 Evidence:T193
T195	Span 2575 2611	for P. aeruginosa biofilms to mature
T196	Span 2813 2976	Since inactivation of each TCS system resulted in altered or arrested biofilms which failed to exhibit stage-specific protein production and phosphorylation events
T197	Causality 3008 3025	it is likely that
E32	Causality:T197 Effect:T198 Evidence:T196
T198	Span 3026 3163	the mutant biofilms in turn do not produce the necessary signal(s) to activate or phosphorylate TCS system(s) that are further downstream
T199	Span 2813 3163	Since inactivation of each TCS system resulted in altered or arrested biofilms which failed to exhibit stage-specific protein production and phosphorylation events (Figs. 1, 4, Suppl. Table S2), it is likely that the mutant biofilms in turn do not produce the necessary signal(s) to activate or phosphorylate TCS system(s) that are further downstream
T200	Causality 3165 3188	Thus, it is likely that
E33	Causality:T200 Effect:T201 Evidence:T199
T201	Span 3189 3288	inactivation of one TCS system (in)directly results in altered or arrested phosphorylation patterns
T202	Causality 3289 3297	and thus
E34	Causality:T202 Evidence:T201 Effect:T203
T203	Span 3299 3367	lack of phosphorylation of downstream TCS systems (as observed here)
T204	Causality 3399 3417	it is evident that
E35	Causality:T204 Effect:T205 Evidence:T201
T205	Span 3418 3635	inactivation not only disrupts the sequence of phosphorylation events but also leads to the collapse of mature biofilms to an earlier biofilm developmental stage at which the respective regulatory proteins play a role
T206	Span 3655 3851	This is even more important as this biofilm collapse was observed under two different nutritional conditions, when grown on minimal medium using either glutamate or citrate as a sole carbon source
T207	Causality 3928 3953	The finding suggests that
E36	Causality:T207 Effect:T208 Evidence:T206
T208	Span 3954 4305	while biofilm formation, architecture and cell-cell signaling is modulated by environmental and nutritional conditions resulting in biofilm development proceeding via distinctly different pathways [16], [55]-[63], it is possible that the novel regulatory proteins identified here play a role under more than one discrete culturing condition or pathway
T209	Span 4307 4331	The novelty of these TCS
T210	Causality 4332 4355	is further supported by
E37	Causality:T210 Evidence:T211 Effect:T209
T211	Span 4356 4605	the finding that a search for BfiS (PA4197) and BfmR (PA4101) homologues using BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) and BLINK (precomputed BLAST, [53]), did not reveal any proteins that have been previously characterized in the literature
T212	Span 5434 5472	Inactivation of crdA has been shown to
T213	Causality 5473 5482	result in
E38	Causality:T213 Effect:T214 Evidence:T212
T214	Span 5483 5527	delayed M. xanthus multicellular development
T215	Span 6049 6117	The preponderance of developmental promoters with sigma 54 hallmarks
T216	Causality 6118 6144	led to the suggestion that
E39	Causality:T216 Effect:T217 Evidence:T215
T217	Span 6145 6280	NtrC-like activators are key components of the transcriptional machinery that coordinates gene expression during M. xanthus development
T218	Causality 7408 7441	These results are consistent with
E40	Causality:T218 Effect:T221 Evidence:T219
T219	Span 7261 7385	MifR harbors a sigma-54 binding (RpoN) binding domain and is dependent on the consecutive phosphorylation of BfiRS and BfmRS
T220	Span 7120 7249	Activation of BfiR coincides with BfiS phosphorylation following 8 hours of surface attached growth and dephosphorylation of RpoD
T221	Span 7443 7816	he idea that biofilm development by P. aeruginosa is orchestrated by a regulatory cascade (Fig. 6) that is analogous to other developmental systems including spore formation in B. subtilis or fruiting body formation in M. xanthus, requiring the consecutive action of at least two sigma factors and three two-component regulatory systems in response to environmental signals
E41	Causality:T218 Effect:T221 Evidence:T220
T222	Span 7980 8214	The only other regulatory system having been identified to play a role at later stages of biofilm formation, in particular the formation of large microcolonies and fluid-filled channels, is the three-component system SadARS (RocS1RA1)
T223	Causality 8216 8216

T228	Span 9122 9300	GacS acts as a suppressor of RetS (and vice versa) with RetS regulating the suppressor activity of the membrane-bound sensor GacS by directly modulating its phosphorylation state
T229	Causality 9307 9337	The finding is consistent with
E44	Causality:T229 Effect:T230 Evidence:T228
T230	Span 9338 9467	our observation of GacS playing a dual role in biofilm formation, with phosphorylation acting as a switch in the function of GacS
T231	Span 9670 9828	Since phosphorylation of GacS occurred following 8 hr of surface attached growth (Table 1) and since RetS directly modulates the phosphorylation state of GacS
T232	Causality 9835 9864	the findings may suggest that
E45	Causality:T232 Effect:T233 Evidence:T231

T234	Span 9670 9986	Since phosphorylation of GacS occurred following 8 hr of surface attached growth (Table 1) and since RetS directly modulates the phosphorylation state of GacS [38], the findings may suggest that RetS only remains functional for a period of 8 hours during initial attachment after which RetS is rendered non-functiona
T235	Span 10059 10155	In turn, expression of the BfiS cognate response regulator, BfiR, was found to be RsmA dependent
T237	Span 10216 10553	a link between the multi-component switch RetS/LadS/GacAS/RsmA which reciprocally regulates virulence and the transition between the planktonic and the surface attached mode of growth and the previously undescribed signaling network which regulates developmental steps once P. aeruginosa has committed to the surface associated lifestyle

T238	Span 10993 11120	the finding of sequential and essential regulatory steps in biofilm formation and the involvement of at least two sigma factors
