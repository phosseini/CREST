T44	Span 61 84	SsrB binds within SPI-2

T49	Span 191 217	SsrB regulation is unusual
T50	Span 816 918	Expression of an episomal copy of ssrB resulted in expression of SPI-2 genes in each mutant background
T51	Causality 920 935	suggesting that

T52	Span 936 997	SsrB is epistatic to other regulators for SPI-2 transcription
T53	Span 816 997	Expression of an episomal copy of ssrB resulted in expression of SPI-2 genes in each mutant background, suggesting that SsrB is epistatic to other regulators for SPI-2 transcription
T54	Causality 999 1031	This result is in agreement with
E14	Causality:T54 Effect:T55 Evidence:T53
T55	Span 1032 1157	the model shown in Figure 6 where all positive regulation takes place via either ssrB or slyA or both as tested further below
T56	Span 1159 1254	Furthermore, SsrB could complement all three deletions DeltassrB, DeltassrA, and DeltassrA/ssrB

T58	Span 1284 1397	over-expression of SsrB may compensate for differences in phosphorylation that normally play a role in regulation
