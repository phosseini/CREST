T12	Span 1884 2069	The results shown in Figure 5 use a force-directed network layout algorithm where genes (shown as small colored circles) are generally closer together when their statistical association

T14	Span 2080 2218	degree of predicted co-regulation, is stronger (the cutoff for the genes shown is 5 standard deviations from the mean or greater; p<.0001)
T15	Span 2220 2352	All SPI-2 secretion apparatus genes as well as associated effectors and chaperones were found to very tightly cluster in the network
T16	Causality 2354 2383	In support of this conclusion

T17	Span 2385 2480	the cluster analyses based on our data and based on publicly available data sets are consistent
T18	Span 2803 2974	Several of these genes are A+T rich (>60% compared to 48% for the Salmonella chromosome) and located within sequences that are not present in close relatives of Salmonella
