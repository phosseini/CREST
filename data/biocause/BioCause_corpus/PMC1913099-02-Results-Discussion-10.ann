T31	Span 522 744	Allelic replacement created two putative deletion mutants; however, RT-PCR analysis (Figure 4A) revealed that only one such clone (SF370Deltaspy0129.2) was a true knock-out for the spy0129 gene and useful for further study
T32	Span 746 913	Because the gene cluster is also an operon, expression of the downstream gene spy0130, encoding the protein F homolog/pilus protein, was also eliminated in this mutant
T33	Span 927 1149	In vitro pharyngeal cell adherence assays revealed that the SF370Deltaspy0129.2 mutant was approximately 66% less adherent than the parental control strain, SF370 (Figure 4B; p = 0.03 as determined by the Student's t-test)

T35	Span 1178 1399	either the spy0130 gene product is involved directly in adherence, or that due to the elimination of the sortase, the pili, which may function in their entirety as adhesins, were not assembled on the surface of the mutant
