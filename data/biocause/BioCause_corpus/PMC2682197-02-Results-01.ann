T37	Span 353 429	replacement of rv2623 with the hyg gene, which confers hygromycin resistance

E6	Causality:T39 Evidence:T40 Effect:T38
T40	Span 620 817	the sequence-confirmed precise excision of the rv2623 coding region and the gene organization at the rv2623 locus (the downstream rv2624c is transcribed in the direction opposite to that of rv2623)

T43	Span 931 1021	an E. coli strain deficient for UspA exhibits reduced survival in stationary phase culture
T44	Span 1028 1232	However, the in vitro growth kinetics of Deltarv2623 M. tuberculosis in OADC-supplemented Middlebrook 7H9 or minimal Sauton's medium is comparable to that of wildtype Erdman up to 14 days post-inoculation
T45	Causality 1246 1262	We reasoned that

T46	Span 1263 1392	a potential growth-regulating attribute of Rv2623 might be masked by functional redundancy among the M. tuberculosis USP homologs
T47	Span 1625 1868	constitutive overexpression of M. tuberculosis rv2623 using the multi-copy plasmid pMV261 resulted in growth deficiency of the recipient strain both on solid medium (Middlebrook 7H10 agar) and in the liquid medium-based BD BACTEC 9000MB system
