T56	Span 1076 1251	Ten genes related with carbon metabolism (pckA and fumB among others) were up-regulated in the bvrR mutant, and denitrification genes (nirK, norC and nosZ) were also regulated
T57	Span 1253 1383	Notably, seven transcriptional regulators were affected, including VjbR, ExoR and OmpR that were less expressed in the bvrR mutant
T58	Span 1395 1500	he expression of eleven genes which have been previously related with Brucella virulence was also altered
