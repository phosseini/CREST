T18	Span 403 552	there was no significant difference between GAS that were isolated from non-invasive and severe invasive infections in phagocytosis by PMN (p=0.5556)
T19	Span 554 733	However, as shown in Figure 1B, in vitro killing assay revealed that PMN killed non-invasive GAS, resulting in 15-42% of initial number of bacteria, but not invasive GAS (p=0.019)
T20	Span 735 855	The similar results were obtained when opsonized with either FCS or human serum regardless of complements immobilization
