T47	Span 36 81	degradation of IL-8 by serine proteinase ScpC
T48	Span 83 243	Although NIH230slo lost the killing activity for PMN, migration of PMN in response to IL-8 in a transwell system was not restored in the presence of this mutant

E15	Causality:T49 Effect:T50 Evidence:T48
T50	Span 282 352	severe invasive GAS blocks PMN migration by influence on IL-8 activity
T51	Span 936 1214	The results showed that NIH230scpC neither digested IL-8, like 1566 strain, (Figure 4B) nor abrogated the migration of PMN in response to IL-8, comparable to 1566 strain (Figure 4A), whereas the mutant killed the migrated PMN as well as the parent strain NIH230 (data not shown)

E16	Causality:T52 Effect:T53 Evidence:T51
T53	Span 1247 1379	clinically isolated invasive GAS impaired PMN recruitment and its survival, as a result of productions of ScpC and SLO, respectively
