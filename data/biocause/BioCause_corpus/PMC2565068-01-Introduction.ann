T65	Span 901 1113	Recently, GAS with diverse emm genotypes, especially, emm49-genotype, have been isolated from patients of severe invasive GAS infections since 2000; however, these genotypes were not isolated before 1999 in Japan

T73	Span 1277 1675	Epidemiological and pathological findings, including sporadic incidents of severe invasive GAS infections [9], high frequency of severe invasive infections in immunocompromised host [9], and aggregation of bacteria and a paucity of polymorphnuclear neutrophils (PMN) in foci of invasive GAS infection [10] suggest that host defense factors play an important role in the onset of invasive infections

T75	Span 1699 1939	to postulate that invasive GAS infections hampered host innate immune defense, especially on PMN, providing the front-line defense against GAS infection by quick recruitment to infection site and clearance of bacteria following phagocytosis
T76	Span 2697 2900	We now show a direct and previously unrecognized link between functional loss of a factor CsrS of two-component sensor/regulator system (CsrS/CsrR: also known as CovS/CovR) and escape from killing by PMN

T79	Span 2979 3204	We further determined CsrS mutations in the severe invasive GAS was essential to control the expression of various virulence genes and contributed to the in vivo virulence and disease-specific pathophysiology in a mouse model
T80	Span 2697 2977	We now show a direct and previously unrecognized link between functional loss of a factor CsrS of two-component sensor/regulator system (CsrS/CsrR: also known as CovS/CovR) and escape from killing by PMN via inducing necrosis to them and digesting IL-8, a PMN-attracting chemokine
