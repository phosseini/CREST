T61	Span 961 1057	an SLO deficient mutant from a STSS isolate NIH230 (NIH230slo) lost the killing activity for PMN
T62	Causality 1071 1104	thereby, strongly suggesting that
E4	Causality:T62 Effect:T63 Evidence:T61
T63	Span 1105 1166	SLO is a key element for PMN killing mediated by invasive GAS
T64	Span 1168 1280	Contrarily, SLS-deficient mutant from NIH230 strain (NIH230sagA) killed PMN, as efficiently as did parent strain
T65	Causality 1282 1297	indicating that
E5	Causality:T65 Effect:T66 Evidence:T64
T66	Span 1298 1360	SLS is dispensable for killing of PMN mediated by invasive GAS
T67	Span 1362 1498	SLO and SLS double mutant GAS from NIH230 strain (NIH230slosagA) displayed the killing activity indistinguishable from that of NIH230slo
T68	Causality 1500 1510	confirming
E6	Causality:T68 Effect:T69 Evidence:T67
T69	Span 1511 1565	the primarily role of SLO for GAS-mediated PMN killing
T70	Span 1590 1710	incubation of PMN with supernatant from co-culture of IL-8 and invasive or non-invasive GAS did not affect PMN viability
T71	Causality 1712 1727	suggesting that
E7	Causality:T71 Effect:T72 Evidence:T70
T72	Span 1728 1830	severe invasive GAS causes PMN killing following encounter with bacteria in a contact-dependent manner
T73	Span 1991 2095	SLO activity of severe invasive isolate NIH230 is increased as twice as that of non-invasive strain 1566
T74	Causality 1832 1847	To confirm that
E8	Causality:T74 Effect:T75 Evidence:T73
T75	Span 1848 1966	SLO activity is increased in invasive GAS strain, we measured SLO hemolytic activity of GAS strains used in this study
