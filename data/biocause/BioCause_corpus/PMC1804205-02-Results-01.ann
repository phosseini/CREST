E15	Causality:T56 Effect:T58 Cause:T57
T57	Fact 331 440	This medium lacked Fe3+ or Al3+, the only known PmrB ligands (Wosten et al., 2000), and contained 10 mM MgCl2
T58	Fact 442 492	which represses expression of PmrA-activated genes
T59	Fact 541 639	All three genes were expressed when cells were grown in media buffered at pH 5.8 but not at pH 7.7
T60	Causality 653 665	in agreement
E16	Causality:T60 Effect:T59 Cause:T61
T61	Fact 666 716	with previous results (Soncini and Groisman, 1996)
T62	Causality 872 882	indicating
E17	Causality:T62 Evidence:T63 Effect:T64
T63	Span 718 853	A similar induction of pbgP transcription was found when MES was used as the buffering agent in the media at pH 5.8 instead of Bis-Tris
T64	Span 883 972	that the mild acid effect on gene expression was not due to a particular buffering system
T66	Span 2032 2208	Moreover, a mutant expressing a derivative of the PmrA protein that cannot be phosphorylated due to substitution of the putative phosphorylation residue aspartate 51 by alanine
#1	AnnotatorNotes T61	Do we need to annotate anything referring back to previous results?
T65	Span 2235 2364	completely failed to promote transcription of PmrA-activated genes in response to pH 5.8, in a similar fashion to the pmrA strain
