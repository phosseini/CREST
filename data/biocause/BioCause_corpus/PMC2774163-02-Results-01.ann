T3	Span 2196 2347	In addition to biofilm stage-specific phosphorylation of proteins, protein phosphorylation events were detectable at more than one biofilm growth stage
T4	Causality 2348 2363	indicating that
E1	Causality:T4 Effect:T5 Evidence:T3
T5	Span 2364 2484	the transition to surface-associated growth coincides with distinct protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events
T6	Span 3536 3633	The reduced similarity in phosphorylation events between biofilms and planktonic cells was mainly
T7	Causality 3634 3640	due to
E2	Causality:T7 Effect:T8 Evidence:T6
T8	Span 3641 3726	biofilm specific phosphorylation events detected at one or more stages of development
T9	Span 3880 4009	The increase in similarity between the planktonic and the 216-hr-old biofilm phosphoproteomes is consistent with previous reports
T10	Causality 4010 4025	indicating that
E3	Causality:T10 Effect:T11 Evidence:T9
T11	Span 4026 4111	cells within dispersion-stage biofilms are returning to the planktonic mode of growth
