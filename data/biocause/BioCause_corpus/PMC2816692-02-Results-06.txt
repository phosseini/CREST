SrcA is required for PipB2-dependent centrifugal displacement of the Salmonella-containing vacuole 
To further show a role for SrcA in chaperoning PipB2, we set up experiments to test whether deleting srcA would phenocopy DeltapipB2 cells for PipB2-dependent centrifugal displacement of the Salmonella containing vacuole (SCV) in epithelial cells, an event linked to cell-to-cell transfer during infection in vitro [29].
At 10 h after infection the majority of SCVs were situated near the nucleus in accordance with previous work (Fig. 6A) [29].
By 24 h after infection SCVs containing wild type bacteria were displaced centrifugally towards the cell periphery whereas SCVs containing either pipB2 or srcA mutant bacteria remained juxtaposed to the nucleus (Fig. 6A).
The average distance from the nucleus of LAMP1+ SCVs containing wild type bacteria was 2.19 microm at 10h post infection and increased to 7.86 microm by 24 h after infection.
Conversely, SCVs containing either DeltapipB2 cells or DeltasrcA cells were 1.38 microm and 2.09 microm at 10h but lacked centrifugal displacement at 24 h (2.23 microm and 2.85 microm, respectively) (Fig. 6B).
