T91	Causality 188 210	It was postulated that
E33	Causality:T91 Effect:T92 Evidence:T93
T92	Span 211 282	different mechanisms might be involved in FimR-mediated mfa1 expression
T93	Span 284 389	since expression regulation of mfa1 by FimR was not controlled as tightly as observed for fimA expression
T94	Span 1597 1681	The unlabeled mfa1 promoter fragments effectively competed with the labeled fragment
T95	Causality 1683 1693	suggesting
E34	Causality:T95 Evidence:T94 Effect:T96
T96	Span 1694 1752	a specific interaction between rFimA and the mfa1 promoter
T97	Span 2062 2170	In agreement with a previous report (Nishikawa et al., 2004), rFimR did not bind to the fimA promoter region
T98	Causality 2172 2187	suggesting that
E35	Causality:T98 Evidence:T97 Effect:T99
T99	Span 2189 2258	egulation of fimA expression by FimR is through a different mechanism
T100	Causality 2468 2496	These data clearly show that
E36	Causality:T100 Effect:T101 Evidence:T103
T101	Span 2497 2605	FimR protein can bind specifically to the mfa1 promoter region, acting as an activator of mfa1 transcription
T102	Span 2260 2372	Moreover, incubation of rHGP44 with mfa1 promoter fragment did not retard the DNA movement in polyacrylamide gel
T103	Span 2374 2466	There was also no DNA shift detected when rFimR was incubated with the coding region of mfa1
E37	Causality:T100 Effect:T101 Evidence:T102
T104	Span 2742 2862	The biotin-labeled DNA fragment corresponding to this promoter region did not shift in the presence of the rFimA protein
T105	Causality 2881 2896	suggesting that
E38	Causality:T105 Evidence:T104 Effect:T106
T106	Span 2897 2979	only the promoter identified here is involved for mfa1 expression mediated by FimR
