T42	Span 942 1048	The precise locations of the Mlc-binding sites were determined by DNase I footprinting with His-tagged Mlc
T43	Span 1050 1228	Two Mlc-binding sites, one at position -10 to +12 (Mlc 1) and the other at position -86 to -108 (Mlc 2) with respect to the transcriptional start site of hilE P3, were identified
T44	Span 1242 1484	Inspection of the DNA sequences at these sites showed high-level homology with the known consensus Mlc-binding sequence, which has the conserved TT-9bp-AA motif and an AT-rich region at positions +/-7 to +/-11, showing imperfect dyad symmetry
