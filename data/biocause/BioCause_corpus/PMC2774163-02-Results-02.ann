T67	Span 375 507	Proteins that were confirmed to be phosphorylated by immunoblot analysis were identified using a mass spectrometric approach as well
T68	Causality 509 516	We thus
E34	Causality:T68 Effect:T69 Evidence:T67
T69	Span 517 790	identified 48 proteins that were differentially phosphorylated at one or more biofilm developmental stage including elongation factors, ribosomal proteins, several enzymes including reductases and GMP synthase, sigma factor RpoD (Suppl. Table S1) and 11 regulatory proteins
T70	Span 2015 2121	Neither the cognate sensory protein PA5512 nor the response regulator PA4196 were identified in this study
T71	Causality 2123 2141	This may be due to
E35	Causality:T71 Evidence:T72 Effect:T70
T72	Span 2142 2348	detection limitation (low protein concentrations, poor protein solubility, poor ionization) and/or limitation in the number of phosphorylated proteins identified (see Suppl. Tables S1 and S2 for comparison)
T73	Span 2705 2836	We therefore analyzed GacS, PA4101, and PA4197 mutant biofilm phosphorylation patterns for the presence/absence of these regulators
T74	Causality 2838 2849	No evidence
E36	Causality:T74 Effect:T75 Evidence:T73
T75	Span 2850 2963	of phosphorylation of PA4197, PA4101, or GacS was detected in DeltaPA4197 mutant biofilm phosphorylation patterns
T76	Span 2974 3057	phosphorylation of both GacS and PA4197 was detected in DeltaPA4101 mutant biofilms
T77	Causality 3059 3074	indicating that
E37	Causality:T77 Effect:T78 Evidence:T76
T78	Span 3075 3137	PA4101 phosphorylation may occur downstream of GacS and PA4197
T79	Span 2974 3137	phosphorylation of both GacS and PA4197 was detected in DeltaPA4101 mutant biofilms, indicating that PA4101 phosphorylation may occur downstream of GacS and PA4197
T80	Span 3139 3298	DeltagacS biofilm phosphorylation patterns showed an intermediate phosphorylation phenotype with PA4197 being phosphorylated but PA4101 phosphorylation lacking
T81	Span 3312 3374	PA5511 was not detected in any of the mutant biofilms analyzed
T82	Causality 3393 3418	The findings suggest that
E38	Causality:T82 Effect:T83 Evidence:T81
T83	Span 3419 3548	phosphorylation of regulatory proteins occurs in a sequential (but probably indirect) manner over the course of biofilm formation
E39	Causality:T82 Effect:T83 Evidence:T80
E40	Causality:T82 Effect:T83 Evidence:T79
T84	Span 3888 3936	retS and ladS were also constitutively expressed
T85	Causality 3937 3952	indicating that
E41	Causality:T85 Effect:T86 Evidence:T84
T86	Span 3953 4017	posttranslational modifications are essential for their activity
