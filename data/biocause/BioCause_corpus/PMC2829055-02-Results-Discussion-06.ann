T57	Span 686 892	Y. pestis grown at <28degreesC in vitro are initially susceptible to in vivo uptake and killing by phagocytes until the Yop and F1 virulence factors are produced, effectively preventing further phagocytosis
T58	Span 226 483	The most important antiphagocytic virulence factors, the cytotoxic Yersinia outer proteins (Yops), part of the T3SS encoded by the Y. pestis virulence plasmid and the F1 capsule encoded by the pMT1 plasmid, are not present at this initial stage of infection
T59	Causality 904 929	Our results indicate that
E25	Causality:T59 Effect:T60 Evidence:T57
T60	Span 930 1114	Y. pestis entering the mammal from an infective flea is relatively resistant to macrophages, as well as PMNs [7]; a vector-specific phenotype that is not related to the T3SS or capsule
E26	Causality:T59 Effect:T60 Evidence:T58
T61	Span 1116 1290	Coming from the flea, Y. pestis is also associated with the biofilm ECM, identical or closely related to the poly-beta-1,6-N-acetyl glucosamine ECM of staphylococcal biofilms
T62	Causality 1292 1312	which has been shown
E27	Causality:T62 Effect:T63 Evidence:T61
T63	Span 1313 1364	to provide protection from innate immune components
T64	Span 1376 1590	In addition, although the antiphagocytic F1 capsule and Psa fimbriae do not appear to be produced in the flea, upregulation in the flea of most F1 genes in the cafRcaf1M1A1 locus and the Psa usher protein gene psaC
T65	Causality 1606 1619	suggests that
E28	Causality:T65 Effect:T66 Evidence:T64
T66	Span 1620 1785	components of the F1 and Psa translocation system are made, which may prime Y. pestis for rapid secretion of these extracellular virulence factors after transmission
T67	Span 1787 1857	The upregulation of the innate immunity resistance genes phoP and mgtC
T68	Causality 1858 1870	suggest that
E29	Causality:T68 Effect:T69 Evidence:T67
T69	Span 1871 2006	those Y. pestis that are phagocytized may be prepared for resistance to CAMPs and intracellular survival while still in the flea vector
T70	Span 2193 2374	Besides degrading plasminogen, the Pla protease may also inactivate CAMPs, particularly when the F1 capsule is not present [57], which matches the phenotype of Y. pestis in the flea
T71	Span 2388 2483	Y. pestis appears to be prepared for pathogenesis in the mammal while still in the flea vector.
T72	Causality 2376 2386	In summary
E30	Causality:T72 Effect:T71 Evidence:T70
T73	Span 2484 2588	The biofilm phenotype of Y. pestis and the virulence factors upregulated or highly expressed in the flea
T74	Causality 2589 2592	may
E31	Causality:T74 Effect:T75 Evidence:T73
T75	Span 2593 2741	enhance the earliest stages of plague pathogenesis while the full complement of temperature-shift-regulated virulence factors is still being induced
T76	Span 2743 2820	Increased resistance to innate immunity that is preinduced in the flea vector
T77	Causality 2821 2827	may be
E32	Causality:T77 Effect:T78 Evidence:T76
T78	Span 2828 2983	critical to productive transmission because blocked fleas transmit relatively few bacteria, often below the LD50 of Y. pestis grown in vitro at <28degreesC
