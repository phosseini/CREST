T88	Span 73 283	Because blockage of the flea vector is essentially a biofilm phenomenon, Y. pestis genes whose expression patterns are significantly upregulated in the flea and flowcell biofilms relative to planktonic cultures
T89	Causality 295 314	might indicate that
E49	Causality:T89 Effect:T90 Evidence:T88
T90	Span 315 344	they are transmission factors
T91	Span 1276 1515	The ymt gene was among the most highly expressed genes in the flea (Table S3), but neither it nor the known transmission factors (hmsHFRS, hmsT, hmsP, and gmhA) showed significantly higher expression in the flea than in vitro at 21degreesC
T93	Causality 1517 1532	indicating that
E51	Causality:T93 Effect:T94 Evidence:T91
T94	Span 1533 1637	they are induced primarily by low temperature, and not by environmental factors specific to the flea gut

E52	Causality:T92 Effect:T95 Evidence:T97

T99	Span 2905 2977	These genes were also found to be upregulated in mature E. coli biofilms

E54	Causality:T100 Effect:T101 Evidence:T99
T101	Span 3000 3104	the three prominent ESR systems are important for integrating signals required for survival in a biofilm
T102	Span 3114 3215	homologs of the yidE, cpxP, tibA (yapL), cupA fimbriae, and pspABC genes were upregulated in the flea

T107	Span 3656 3838	Although genes in the polyamine transport gabTpotDBC locus are among the most highly induced genes in the flea (Table S1) and polyamines are essential for Y. pestis biofilm formation

E57	Causality:T108 Effect:T109 Evidence:T107
T109	Span 3878 3949	a Y. pestis Deltapot mutant has no defect in flea infection or blockage
T110	Span 3656 3949	Although genes in the polyamine transport gabTpotDBC locus are among the most highly induced genes in the flea (Table S1) and polyamines are essential for Y. pestis biofilm formation [30], we have previously reported that a Y. pestis Deltapot mutant has no defect in flea infection or blockage
T111	Causality 3956 3977	This is likely due to
E58	Causality:T111 Evidence:T112 Effect:T110
T112	Span 3978 4042	the fact that Y. pestis is able to synthesize polyamines de novo
