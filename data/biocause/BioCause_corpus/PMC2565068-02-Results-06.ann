T56	Span 440 509	an increase in the LD50 value comparable to that of the NIH230 strain
T57	Span 511 675	Consistently, an introduction of the intact csrS gene into the NIH230 strain (NIH230::csrS+) reduced the LD50 value to the level observed in the non-invasive strain
T58	Span 251 509	The non-invasive 1566 strain displayed the LD50 value approximately 100-fold higher than that of the severe invasive NIH230 strain (Table 1), whereas a csrS deletion (1566DeltacsrS) caused an increase in the LD50 value comparable to that of the NIH230 strain

T62	Span 1665 1831	the invasive GAS isolates are more virulent in vivo than non-invasive GAS, and impair PMN function in vivo, owing, at least in part, to the mutations in the csrS gene

T63	Span 1487 1636	Figure 7D shows that subcutaneous infection of NIH230 formed the infected lesions with area significantly larger than those of 1566 and NIH230::csrS+
T64	Span 1091 1303	Histopathologically, in the mice injected with the NIH230 strain, bacteria formed clusters in interstitial tissues in the kidneys and the lungs, accompanied congestion and no inflammatory cells at infectious foci
T65	Span 784 1089	As shown in Figure 7A, the NIH230 strain caused bacteremia in mice 24 h after intraperitoneal injection whereas the bacteremia was barely detected in mice infected with NIH230::csrS+as well as the 1566 strain (p=0.005 compared with non-invasive isolates, and p=0.005 compared with invasive isolates +CsrS)
T66	Span 1340 1466	Contrarily, no significant pathological alterations were observed in the mice injected with the 1566 and NIH230::csrS+ strains
