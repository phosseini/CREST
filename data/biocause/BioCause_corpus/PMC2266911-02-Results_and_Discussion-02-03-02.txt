Oxygenases and hydrolases 
P. luminescens produces proteins similar to monooxygenases, dioxygenases and hydroxylases that have been suggested to play a role in rapid elimination of insect polyphenols or in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species generated by the invaded host [24].
Examples are the product of plu4258, adjacent to a gene encoding glutathione transferase (plu4259), a putative steroid monooxygenase (Plu4232), and a glycine oxidase (Plu2242), all of which have no counterparts in Y. enterocolitica.
Factors present in both pathogens are two monooxigenases encoded by ye1945/hpaC (plu0974) and ye3394/plu3599, and two hydroxylases encoded by ubiH (ye3395/plu3600) and ubiF (ye2984/plu1313).
It is therefore possible that the Y. enterocolitica homologues of these enzymes are involved in persistence within the insect, a mechanism which is also used by P. luminescens.
