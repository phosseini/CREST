T60	Span 285 440	Inactivation of BfiS, BfmR, and MifR (PA4197, PA4101, PA5511, respectively) did not affect initial attachment to polystyrene compared to wild type biofilms
T61	Causality 441 455	as revealed by
E14	Causality:T61 Evidence:T62 Effect:T60
T62	Span 456 525	the crystal violet microtiter plate assay and confirmed by microscopy
T63	Span 552 728	no difference in growth in broth or defect with respect to twitching, swimming, and swarming or Pel and Psl polysaccharide production was detected for any of the mutant strains
T64	Span 755 932	no difference in transcript abundance, as determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, of genes involved in Pel and Psl polysaccharide biosynthesis compared to wild type was detected
T65	Span 955 1114	a DeltagacS mutant showed 10-fold reduced initial attachment compared to the wild type (not shown), consistent with previous findings by Parkins and colleagues
T66	Causality 1121 1148	These findings implied that
E15	Causality:T66 Effect:T67 Evidence:T65
T67	Span 1149 1276	the novel regulatory proteins were involved in the regulation of biofilm formation at later stages following initial attachment
E16	Causality:T66 Effect:T67 Evidence:T64

T68	Causality 1550 1558	Based on
E18	Causality:T68 Evidence:T69 Effect:T70
T69	Span 1559 1596	the comparison of 5 biofilm variables
T70	Span 1598 1751	both mutant biofilms were more similar to 24-hr-old biofilms, with DeltabfmR forming more substantial biofilms than DeltabfiS or 24 hr wild type biofilms
T71	Span 1889 1986	Comparison of the DeltamifR biofilm architecture following 144 hr of growth to wild type biofilms
T72	Causality 1987 2001	indicated that
E19	Causality:T72 Effect:T73 Evidence:T71
T73	Span 2002 2058	DeltamifR biofilms were comparable to 72-hr-old biofilms
T74	Span 2060 2148	Since MifR was detected to be phosphorylated following 72 hr of biofilm growth (Table 1)
T75	Causality 2150 2176	our findings indicate that
E20	Causality:T75 Effect:T76 Evidence:T74
T76	Span 2177 2330	phosphorylation of MifR is essential for the progression of P. aeruginosa biofilms from the maturation-1 stage (72 hr) to the maturation-2 stage (144 hr)
T77	Causality 3360 3394	The findings clearly indicate that
E21	Causality:T77 Effect:T84 Evidence:T82
T78	Causality 3490 3517	our findings suggested that
E22	Causality:T78 Effect:T83 Evidence:T82
T80	Span 2713 2951	However, while wild type biofilms continued to mature/develop upon prolonged incubation (see Fig. 2A), no additional biomass accumulation or alteration in architecture was observed for DeltabfiS and DeltabfmR biofilms post 24 hr of growth
T81	Span 2953 3125	Furthermore, for DeltamifR biofilms, the progression of biofilm formation was indistinguishable from wild type P. aeruginosa biofilm formation for the first 72 hr of growth
T82	Span 3127 3358	However, continued incubation did not result in increased DeltamifR biofilm growth (biomass, thickness) or microcolony formation typically seen in wild type biofilms at the maturation-2 stage (post 72 hr of growth, Table 2, Fig. 2)
T83	Span 3518 3631	the mutant biofilms were incapable of progressing from the initial attachment stage to more mature biofilm stages
T84	Span 3395 3479	inactivation of these novel regulatory proteins did not cause biofilm disaggregation
