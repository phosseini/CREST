E2	Causality:T24 Effect:T25 Evidence:T26
T25	Span 1045 1152	both genes likely encode RNA-binding proteins, in agreement with their functionally defined cluster members
T26	Span 856 1010	The spy1723 gene product has similar domain structure to the YlxR protein of S. pneumoniae, an RNA-binding protein implicated in transcription termination
T27	Span 775 854	Based on structural characterization, SP14.3 is a predicted RNA-binding protein
T28	Span 577 773	BlastP analysis aligned the spy1725 gene product, which has homologs in all sequenced streptococcal genomes, with the SP14.3 protein from S. pneumoniae [52] (80% sequence similarity; 67% identity)
