T14	Span 45 210	The growth curve of the DeltavicK mutant in THY displays a longer early growth phase and smaller slope in the exponential growth phase than that of the parent strain
T15	Causality 222 237	indicating that
E1	Causality:T15 Effect:T16 Evidence:T14
T16	Span 238 292	the vicK deletion detrimentally affects S. equi growth
T17	Span 642 792	The growth factors, the ratio of cfu in the sample at 4 h over cfu at time zero, were 250 and 66 for the wild type and DeltavicK strains, respectively
T18	Causality 804 808	Thus
E2	Causality:T18 Effect:T19 Evidence:T17
T19	Span 810 900	the DeltavicK mutant has significantly reduced ability to grow in rabbit blood (P <0.0001)
