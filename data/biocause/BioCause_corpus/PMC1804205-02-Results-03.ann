T62	Span 372 442	Expression of the pbgP gene was abolished in a pmrB pmrD double mutant
T63	Causality 452 467	indicating that
E22	Causality:T63 Effect:T64 Evidence:T62
T64	Span 468 533	both genes are necessary to activate PmrA under acidic conditions
T65	Span 535 644	In contrast to the phenotype of the pta ackA double mutant, pbgP transcription was reduced in the pmrD mutant
T66	Causality 655 679	These results imply that
E23	Causality:T66 Effect:T65 Evidence:T67
T67	Span 680 829	the pmrD gene was being expressed even though the media contained 10 mM MgCl2, a concentration known to repress transcription of PhoP-activated genes
T68	Causality 1226 1233	because
E24	Causality:T68 Effect:T69 Evidence:T70
T69	Span 1091 1225	This acid pH-promoted increase appears to be specific to a subset of PhoP-activated genes (our unpublished results) that includes pmrD
T70	Span 1234 1352	expression of the PhoP-regulated slyA gene and the PhoP-independent corA gene was not affected by the pH of the medium
T71	Causality 1720 1760	which is in agreement with the fact that
E25	Causality:T71 Effect:T73 Evidence:T72
T72	Fact 1761 1824	PhoP is the only known direct transcriptional activator of pmrD
T73	Fact 1650 1718	The acid-promoted expression of the PmrD protein was phoPQ-dependent
