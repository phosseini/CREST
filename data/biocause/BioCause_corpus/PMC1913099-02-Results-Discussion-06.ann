T21	Span 753 937	We also identified the adherence-mediated upregulation of four transcriptional regulators (Table 1), suggestive of an adaptive response to host cell contact that is dynamic and complex
T22	Span 939 1256	For example, RopB (encoded by spy2042), a member of the Rgg family of response regulators, interacts with a number of regulatory networks throughout the streptococcal genome (e.g., mga, csrRS, sagA, and fasBCA), affecting the transcription of numerous proteins, virulence factors, and two-component regulatory systems
