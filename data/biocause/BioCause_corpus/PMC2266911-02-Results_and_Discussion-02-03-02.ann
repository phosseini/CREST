T28	Span 288 519	Examples are the product of plu4258, adjacent to a gene encoding glutathione transferase (plu4259), a putative steroid monooxygenase (Plu4232), and a glycine oxidase (Plu2242), all of which have no counterparts in Y. enterocolitica
T29	Span 521 710	Factors present in both pathogens are two monooxigenases encoded by ye1945/hpaC (plu0974) and ye3394/plu3599, and two hydroxylases encoded by ubiH (ye3395/plu3600) and ubiF (ye2984/plu1313)
