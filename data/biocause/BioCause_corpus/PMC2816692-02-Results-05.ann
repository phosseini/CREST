T29	Span 215 428	First, we used stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) [28] in conjunction with quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics to identify cargo immunoprecipitated with SrcA from Salmonella
T30	Span 55 213	Since structural and biochemical data unambiguously defined SrcA as a T3SS-associated chaperone, we used two experimental approaches to identify SrcA cargo(s)

E7	Causality:T31 Effect:T30 Evidence:T29
T32	Span 1575 1848	Secondly, to verify the mass spectrometry data and to identify other possible effector cargo, we examined the secretion profiles of wild type cells and an srcA mutant that each expressed HA-tagged effector genes, the products of which are secreted by the SPI-2-encoded T3SS
E8	Causality:T31 Effect:T30 Evidence:T32
T33	Span 1850 2024	Using this approach SseL-HA and PipB2-HA were depleted from the secreted protein fraction of srcA mutant cells (Fig. 5C) but reached similar levels in the bacterial cytoplasm

E9	Causality:T34 Effect:T35 Evidence:T33
T35	Span 2048 2170	from data with the complemented mutant in vivo, expression of srcA in trans restored effector secretion in the srcA mutant
