T19	Span 1202 1351	In Y. enterocolitica, the insecticidal toxin genes are located on a distinct genomic island termed tc-PAIYe of 21 kb, and are low-temperature induced
T20	Span 1358 1556	imilar islands in which regulatory genes are followed by three tca genes, phage-related genes and one or two tccC genes, are present in the genomes of Y. pseudotuberculosis IP32953 and Y. pestis KIM
T21	Span 1558 1770	In P. luminescens, the insecticidal genes are organized in the tcd island harbouring nine tcd- and tcc-like genes and several non tc-like genes, while further nine tcc-like genes are scattered over the chromosome

T23	Span 1792 2138	the over-represence of tc-like genes in the P. luminescens genome might reflect the different strategies followed by both bacteria within insects, namely the rapid killing for exploiting the victim as a food source in case of P. luminescens, and infection of and persistance within the invertebrate host as possibly preferred by Y. enterocolitica
