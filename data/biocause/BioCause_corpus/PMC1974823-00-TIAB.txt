Porphyromonas gingivalis short fimbriae are regulated by a FimS/FimR two-component system 
Porphyromonas gingivalis possesses two distinct fimbriae.
The long (FimA) fimbriae have been extensively studied.
Expression of the fimA gene is tightly controlled by a two-component system (FimS/FimR) through a cascade regulation.
The short (Mfa1) fimbriae are less understood.
The authors have recently demonstrated that both fimbriae are required for formation of P. gingivalis biofilms.
Here, the novel finding that FimR, a member of the two-component regulatory system, is a transcriptional activator of the mfa1 gene is promoted.
Unlike the regulatory mechanism of FimA by FimR, this regulation of the mfa1 gene is accomplished by FimR directly binding to the promoter region of mfa1.
