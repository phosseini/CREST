T45	Span 638 834	It is interesting to note that there is only one bacterium else, the insect colonizing S. glossinidius, whose genome also carries a series of unclustered genes coding for PAS_4/LuxR-like receptors

T51	Span 1237 1349	Met has been shown to bind JH at physiological concentrations and is therefore suspected to act as a JH receptor
T52	Causality 1359 1368	Therefore
E5	Causality:T52 Effect:T53 Evidence:T51
T53	Span 1370 1575	the potential PAS_4/LuxR-like receptors of P. luminescens, Y. enterocolitica, and S. glossinidius might sense JH or other eukaryotic hormones of the insect to adapt their gene expression to the insect host
T54	Span 1577 1652	The high number of 35 highly homologous receptor proteins in P. luminescens
T55	Causality 1653 1661	might be

T56	Span 1662 1741	the reason for the wide insect host spectrum this pathogen is capable to infect
T57	Span 1879 1993	The difference in the number of the uncommon LuxR-like receptors (35 in P. luminescens, nine in Y. enterocolitica)
T58	Causality 1994 2025	gives rise to speculations that

T59	Span 2027 2116	he insect host spectrum is constricted for Y. enterocolitica compared with P. luminescens
