T14	Span 46 259	The interaction between SrcA and SsaN supports an emerging paradigm whereby secretion chaperones bring effector cargo to the T3SS through physical interaction with the hexameric ATPase at the base of the apparatus

T16	Span 288 446	for chaperone-ATPase components in the flagellar type III system [17] and in non-flagellar type III systems in E. coli [27] and the SPI-1 system in Salmonella
T17	Span 453 669	Our work shows the first chaperone-ATPase interaction for a T3SS functioning from within an intracellular vacuolar compartment and supports this interaction as a more generalize feature of type III secretion function
T18	Span 672 958	n our experiments, we could induce the ATPase domain of SsaN to oligomerize in the presence of SrcA, but not in its absence, which was intriguing because the purified enzyme lacked a domain at the carboxyl terminus thought to be involved in oligomer stability, at least for E. coli EscN

T20	Span 989 1134	type III chaperones might have an as yet undefined role in assembly of the ATPase homohexamer that gives rise to efficient effector translocation
