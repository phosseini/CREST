Conclusion 
Based on these and other data [4,12-15], the genetic interaction between sigmaE and a subset of SsrB-regulated genes may serve to coordinate the spatial and temporal activation of virulence genes in a host setting, likely in response to membrane damage resulting from oxidative anti-microbial systems and membrane-targeted host defence peptides.
