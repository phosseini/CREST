T32	Span 390 450	if Rv2623 provides M. tuberculosis protection against stress
T33	Causality 452 477	it might be expected that
E6	Causality:T33 Evidence:T32 Effect:T34
T34	Span 478 533	the Rv2623-deficient mutant would be attenuated in vivo
T35	Span 83 288	Although the functions of universal stress proteins have yet to be completely defined, there is evidence that many USPs play differential roles in protecting microbes against various environmental stresses
T36	Causality 294 303	Therefore
E7	Causality:T36 Effect:T37 Evidence:T35
T37	Span 305 388	the hypervirulence of Deltarv2623 in guinea pigs and susceptible mice is intriguing
T38	Span 864 1088	The use of streptonigrin, an antibiotic whose toxicity correlates with levels of free iron, was based on the observation that the intracellular environment of macrophages can induce a iron-scavenging response in mycobacteria

T42	Span 1241 1395	The results showed that the mutant strain was no more susceptible to growth inhibition than was wild type Erdman under all of the stress conditions tested

E10	Causality:T43 Effect:T44 Evidence:T42
T44	Span 1447 1640	it is unlikely that M. tuberculosis Rv2623 is essential for resistance to stresses encountered in the host, which is consistent with the observed in vivo hypervirulence phenotype of Deltarv2623
