T44	Span 346 419	SDS-PAGE analysis of affinity-purified His6-Rv2623 revealed a single band
T45	Causality 420 424	that
E8	Causality:T45 Effect:T46 Evidence:T44
T46	Span 425 541	approximates the predicted molecular mass of approximately31.6 kDa, which was identified by immunoblotting as Rv2623
T47	Span 555 718	Gel filtration analysis of native His6-Rv2623 revealed that the purified protein exists primarily as a single species with an apparent molecular mass of 61+/-1 kDa
T48	Causality 720 735	suggesting that
E9	Causality:T48 Effect:T49 Evidence:T47
T49	Span 736 777	Rv2623 is a dimer under native conditions

T51	Span 831 894	using nano electrospray ionization (nano ESI) mass spectrometry
T52	Span 1117 1213	On the basis of structures of ATP-binding and non-ATP-binding USPs, a G-2X-G-9X-G(S/T) motif was
T53	Causality 1214 1229	suggested to be
E11	Causality:T53 Effect:T54 Evidence:T52
T54	Span 1230 1262	essential for the binding of ATP
T55	Span 1117 1262	On the basis of structures of ATP-binding and non-ATP-binding USPs, a G-2X-G-9X-G(S/T) motif was suggested to be essential for the binding of ATP
T56	Span 1269 1418	The presence of this motif in each of the two tandem USP domains of Rv2623 [7] raised the possibility that this protein possesses ATP binding activit

T58	Span 1421 1497	An HPLC-based examination of supernatants from boiled samples of His6-Rv2623
T59	Causality 1498 1515	demonstrated that
E13	Causality:T59 Effect:T60 Evidence:T58
T60	Span 1516 1561	His6-Rv2623 co-purifies with both ATP and ADP
T61	Span 1574 1648	Analysis of E. coli-expressed Rv2623 using nano ESI mass spectrometry also
T62	Causality 1649 1666	demonstrated that
E14	Causality:T62 Effect:T63 Evidence:T61
T63	Span 1667 1803	an ATP-saturated form of dimeric Rv2623 (composed of 2 bound ATP molecules per monomer) constitutes at least half of the purified sample
T64	Span 1822 2151	Measurement of the binding stoichiometry, which comprised HPLC-based quantification of adenine nucleotides from the boiled supernatant and spectral analysis of heat denatured Rv2623 following reconstitution in 6 M guanidine-HCl, yields 1.4+/-0.2 nucleotide equivalents/monomer with an overall content of 86+/-4% ATP (14+/-4% ADP)
T65	Causality 2153 2157	Thus
E15	Causality:T65 Effect:T66 Evidence:T64
T66	Span 2159 2335	Rv2623 binds endogenous adenine nucleotides in E. coli, and the association is sufficiently tight that nearly 75% of the nucleotide binding sites are occupied upon purification
