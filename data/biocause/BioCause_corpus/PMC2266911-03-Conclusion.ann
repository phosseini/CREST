T26	Span 2558 2745	Y. enterocolitica, similar to Y. pestis, has developed a strategy to infect and proliferate in insects, and use these organisms rather as transmission vectors than as pure nutrient source
T27	Span 2247 2491	n contrast, only highly concentrated protein extracts of Y. enterocolitica are toxic for M. sexta [7], and a low insect larvae mortality has been observed following injection of approximately 3.5 x 106 Y. enterocolitica cells into the hemolymph
T28	Span 2054 2238	Moreover, P. luminescens is pathogenic to a variety of insect larvae, and a dose of <5 colony-forming units directly injected into the blood system is sufficient to kill within 48-72 h
T29	Span 1045 1435	Dissecting the genomes of Y. enterocolitica and P. luminescens for putative key regulators, we identified factor groups (AI-2, PAS-4/LuxR like receptors) possibly involved in pathogen-insect association only, those with members contributing to either insect or mammalian pathogenicity (QS, TKS, Usp), and c-di-GMP signalling probably not involved in regulation of activities against insects
