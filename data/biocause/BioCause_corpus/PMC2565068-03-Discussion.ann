T155	Causality 12 42	It have been demonstrated that
E44	Causality:T155 Effect:T156 Evidence:T157
T156	Span 43 153	CsrS/R is a member of the two-component regulatory systems for regulating the multipe virulence factors of GAS
T157	Span 155 200	by using genetically- manipulated GAS mutants
T158	Span 560 749	Introduction of the intact csrS gene into the severe invasive GAS restored the susceptibility to the killing by PMN and abrogated the activity for inhibition of PMN recruitment and survival
T159	Causality 751 770	thus, demonstrating
E45	Causality:T159 Effect:T160 Evidence:T158
T160	Span 772 935	n instructional role of the loss-of-functional mutations in csrS gene for the evasion of PMN functions, providing unique pathophysiology of invasive GAS infections
T161	Span 1445 1555	The frequency of the mutation in the csrS gene is higher than that in csrR (csrS mutation:csrR mutation=59:19)
T162	Causality 1585 1595	suggesting
E46	Causality:T162 Effect:T163 Evidence:T161
T163	Span 1596 1716	the csrS mutation is more important in comparison with that of csrR in the clinical isolates regardless of emm genotypes
T164	Span 3424 3526	However, we confirmed that addition of DNase in the culture did not alter the level of PI-positive PMN
T165	Causality 3528 3535	meaning
E47	Causality:T165 Effect:T166 Evidence:T164
T166	Span 3536 3600	bright PI staining of PMN is not due to release of NETs from PMN
T167	Span 3615 3702	DNase activity of the emm49 severe invasive GAS was lower than that of non-invasive GAS
T168	Causality 3717 3732	possibly due to
E48	Causality:T168 Evidence:T169 Effect:T167
T169	Span 3733 3759	the difference of emm type
T170	Span 3761 3884	The expression of DNase as well as the slo and the scpC genes in emm1-genotype strains was enhanced under the csrS mutation
T171	Causality 3890 3908	These suggest that
E49	Causality:T171 Effect:T172 Evidence:T170
T172	Span 3909 3980	DNase may be important but redundant for induction of invasive diseases
T173	Span 3424 3600	However, we confirmed that addition of DNase in the culture did not alter the level of PI-positive PMN, meaning bright PI staining of PMN is not due to release of NETs from PMN
T174	Span 3615 3759	DNase activity of the emm49 severe invasive GAS was lower than that of non-invasive GAS (Figure S1B), possibly due to the difference of emm type

E51	Causality:T171 Effect:T172 Evidence:T173
T175	Causality 3982 3991	Therefore
E52	Causality:T175 Evidence:T170 Effect:T176
T176	Span 3994 4349	he second important observation in the present study is that an essential requirement of csrS mutation for invasive infection is associated with increased expression of ScpC and SLO and in vitro evasion of PMN functions, though we do not exclude the possibility that other CsrS-regulating factors contribute to the escape of invasive GAS from host defense
T177	Causality 6665 6697	Thus, these results suggest that
E53	Causality:T177 Effect:T178 Evidence:T179
T178	Span 6698 6838	the ability of incompetence for PMN functions by individual GAS strain may determine the induction and clinical outcome of invasive diseases
T179	Span 5214 5643	In the present study, we observed that SLO concentration in a short-time culture with severe invasive GAS did not reach the threshold level to kill PMN by formation of pores (data not shown) and that PMN did not undergo necrosis upon incubation with culture media of severe invasive GAS (Figure 3B), leading to the novel possibility that PMN are probably killed following encounter with invasive GAS in a contact-dependent manner
T180	Span 5645 5821	PMN-binding GAS may make a small interface containing a high concentration of SLO between bacteria and PMN, which resembles to killing mechanism of killer cells to target cells
T181	Span 6096 6444	In contrast to the previous view [18], we observed that both of ScpC and SLO together, but not each of them, mediated sufficient in vivo virulence (Table 1), thus compatible with the notion that plural virulence-associated factors under the regulation of csrS abrogate PMN bactericidal functions and induce invasive diseases in in vivo animal model
T182	Span 6446 6658	Consistently, the high mortality and histopathological findings which lacks PMN infiltration in mice tissues infected with csrS-mutated GAS (Figure 7) are similar to those seen in clinical invasive GAS infections
E54	Causality:T177 Effect:T178 Evidence:T180
E55	Causality:T177 Effect:T178 Evidence:T181
E56	Causality:T177 Effect:T178 Evidence:T182
T183	Span 6840 7094	Several clinical reports seem to support this hypothesis; Leukocytopenia seen in patients with STSS is more severe than that with non-STSS [33], and invasive GAS-infected patients with leukocytopenia show worse prognosis than those without leukocytopenia
T184	Causality 7302 7330	These evidences suggest that
E57	Causality:T184 Effect:T186 Evidence:T183
T185	Span 7107 7300	Furthermore, predisposing factors for severe invasive GAS infection [9], such as diabetes mellitus [35], liver cirrhosis [36], and congestive heart failure [37] are known to impair PMN function
T186	Span 7331 7525	the level of PMN function is one of the critical factors to determine the threshold for the onset of invasive GAS infection, which may be the reason for rare outbreaks of invasive GAS infections
E58	Causality:T184 Effect:T186 Evidence:T185
T187	Causality 7527 7531	Thus
E59	Causality:T187 Evidence:T186 Effect:T188
T188	Span 7534 7671	nhanced expression of virulence factors that could evade PMN function is a key issue at first step to cause invasive bacterial infections
