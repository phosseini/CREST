T31	Span 661 814	For instance, electronegative surface residues on the SigE chaperone in the SPI-1-encoded T3SS negatively affect cargo secretion, but not cargo stability

T33	Span 544 659	a docking recognition function with other components of the type III apparatus, possibly the T3SS-accociated ATPase
T34	Span 821 980	In enteropathogenic E. coli, a surface-exposed electronegative residue in the CesT chaperone (Glu142) likewise contributes to Tir secretion but not Tir binding

T36	Span 998 1083	a role in either targeting bound cargo to the T3SS or in the secretion process itself
T37	Span 1085 1289	Interestingly, SrcA lacks 17-amino acids that make up the carboxyl terminus of CesT, which includes Glu142, and yet it still retains effector binding, ATPase binding and effector secretion functionalities
T38	Causality 1291 1314	Thus, it is likely that

T39	Span 1315 1487	other surface charged residues of SrcA are involved in these functions or that SrcA targets effector cargo to the secretion apparatus through a mechanism distinct from CesT
