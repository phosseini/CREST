T120	Span 547 657	A comparison of the transcriptional level of the mfa1 in P. gingivalis wild-type strain and in the fimR mutant
T121	Causality 658 672	indicates that
E39	Causality:T121 Evidence:T120 Effect:T122
T122	Span 673 804	the FimS/FimR system is a positive regulator for the mfa1 gene, although the system controls two fimbrial genes at different levels
T123	Span 1144 1232	Here it is demonstrated that FimR binds directly to the promoter region of the mfa1 gene
T124	Causality 1234 1244	suggesting
E40	Causality:T124 Evidence:T123 Effect:T125
T125	Span 1245 1299	a direct role of FimR in activation of mfa1 expression
T126	Span 1301 1410	It has also been reported previously that the transcriptional activity of fimA was reduced in the fimA mutant
T127	Causality 1412 1422	indicating

T128	Span 1423 1485	multiple levels of control of fimA expression in P. gingivalis
T129	Span 1301 1485	It has also been reported previously that the transcriptional activity of fimA was reduced in the fimA mutant, indicating multiple levels of control of fimA expression in P. gingivalis
T130	Causality 1507 1523	This may explain
E42	Causality:T130 Effect:T131 Evidence:T129
T131	Span 1524 1575	the much tighter control of fimA expression by FimR
T132	Span 2019 2142	However, no apparent difference was found in DNA-binding affinity between rFimRs with or without acetyl phosphate treatment
T133	Causality 2144 2169	Observation suggests that
E43	Causality:T133 Evidence:T132 Effect:T134
T134	Span 2170 2239	different mechanisms may be involved in P. gingivalis FimR activation
T135	Span 2477 2532	The fact that FimR was not activated by phosphorylation
T136	Causality 2533 2551	may also be due to
E44	Causality:T136 Effect:T135 Evidence:T137
T137	Span 2552 2641	the short lifetime of the phosphorylated state, which has been observed in other bacteria
T138	Span 2664 2842	The transcriptional start site of the mfa1 gene located at 434 bp upstream of the putative start codon was detected, which is also 390 bp upstream of the site previously reported
T139	Span 2864 2934	The transcriptional site revealed here is confirmed by RT-PCR analysis

E47	Causality:T143 Evidence:T142 Effect:T144
T144	Span 3214 3314	this promoter may make significant contributions toward mfa1 expression through the FimS/FimR system
T145	Span 3918 4104	The observations that FimR binds only to the upstream promoter region of the mfa1 gene and that activity of the downstream promoter is inhibited by S. gordonii, S. sanguinis and S. mitis
T146	Causality 4125 4130	imply
E48	Causality:T146 Effect:T147 Evidence:T145
T147	Span 4131 4178	the complexity of regulation of mfa1 expression
T148	Span 5132 5275	Expression of major fimbriae (FimA) is extremely low in the fimR mutant, and minor fimbriae production in this mutant is inhibited by least 50%
T149	Causality 5277 5286	Therefore
E49	Causality:T149 Evidence:T148 Effect:T150
T150	Span 5288 5385	it is proposed that FimR can be an attractive target for inhibition of P. gingivalis colonization
