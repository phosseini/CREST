E3	Causality:T40 Effect:T41 Evidence:T39
T41	Span 707 773	SeMac does not inhibit opsonophagocytosis of S. equi by horse PMNs
T42	Span 775 849	The inability of SeMac to inhibit S. equi opsonophagocytosis by horse PMNs
T43	Causality 850 863	may be due to
E4	Causality:T43 Evidence:T44 Effect:T42
T44	Span 864 913	its inability to cleave the majority of horse IgG
T45	Causality 915 930	If this is true
E5	Causality:T45 Effect:T46 Evidence:T47
T46	Span 932 1035	SeMac should inhibit opsonophagocytosis of GAS by human PMNs, since SeMac efficiently cleaves human IgG
T47	Span 775 913	The inability of SeMac to inhibit S. equi opsonophagocytosis by horse PMNs may be due to its inability to cleave the majority of horse IgG
T48	Span 1119 1184	SeMac indeed inhibits the opsonophagocytosis of GAS by human PMNs
T49	Causality 1196 1222	These results suggest that
E6	Causality:T49 Effect:T50 Evidence:T48
T50	Span 1223 1301	IgG endopeptidase activity of SeMac is critical for inhibition of phagocytosis
