T172	Span 562 682	Interestingly, all genes related with carbohydrate, amino or fatty acids metabolism were up-regulated in the bvrR mutant
T173	Span 684 1298	These included the first enzyme in gluconeogenesis (pckA, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, BAB1_2091), four genes involved in TCA cycle and pyruvate metabolism (fumB, fumarate hydratase, BAB1_0977; lpdA, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, BAB2_0712; pyruvate dehydrogenase, BAB2_0032; acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, BAB2_0443), three genes involved in amino or fatty acid metabolism (aldehyde dehydrogenases, BAB2_1130, BAB2_1114; hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase, BAB1_0017), and two genes involve in benzoate degradation (pcaC, carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase, BAB2_0597; pcaI, coenzyme A transferase, BAB2_0604)

E47	Causality:T178 Effect:T179 Evidence:T177
T179	Span 2664 2779	the bacteria could use these denitrification reactions to grow under low-oxygen condition by respiration of nitrate
T180	Span 2781 2937	Brucella may also take advantage of denitrification to cope with nitric oxide (NO) production in the macrophage during the innate response against infection

T183	Span 2320 2495	The nitrite reductase gene ( nirK, BAB2_0943) was down regulated and the nitric oxide and nitrous oxide reductases genes ( nor C, BAB2_0955; nosZ, BAB2_0928) were up regulated
T184	Span 2498 2605	On the other hand, two deaminases (glutaminase, BAB2_0863; guanine deaminase, BAB1_0383) were also affected

T189	Span 4678 4793	in Brucella the PTS could interact with the BvrS sensor kinase, which in turn phosphorylates the response regulator

T196	Span 5337 5461	A link between carbon and nitrogen metabolism, PTS and two-component regulatory systems have been proposed for some bacteria
