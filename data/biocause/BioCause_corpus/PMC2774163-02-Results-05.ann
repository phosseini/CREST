T26	Span 406 481	Closer inspection of biofilm formation by DeltagacS over a period of 144 hr
T27	Causality 492 506	indicated that
E5	Causality:T27 Effect:T28 Evidence:T26
T28	Span 507 672	the biofilm architecture (seen after 144 hr) was due to accelerated biofilm growth followed by premature disaggregation of biofilms as compared to wild type biofilms
T29	Span 1125 1231	Continued growth for more than 72 hr, however, resulted in the disaggregation of DeltagacS mutant biofilms
T30	Causality 1232 1247	as indicated by
E6	Causality:T30 Effect:T31 Evidence:T29
T31	Span 1248 1392	the presence of large, detached clusters floating in the bulk liquid, and a significantly reduced attached biofilm biomass and biofilm thickness
T32	Span 674 876	DeltagacS mutant biofilms were significantly thicker than wild type biofilms following 1 and 72 hr of growth under flowing conditions, forming microcolonies and clusters exceeding 150 microm in diameter
T33	Span 887 1105	At both time points, DeltagacS biofilms not only exceeded the average microcolony size typically seen for wild type biofilms of the same age, but also the biomass and thickness of wild type biofilms at more mature ages
T34	Causality 1412 1416	Thus
E7	Causality:T34 Effect:T35 Evidence:T33
T35	Span 1418 1577	while growth of DeltagacS mutant biofilms following 24 hr post attachment was accelerated (Fig. 3), initial attachment was significantly reduced in this mutant
E8	Causality:T34 Effect:T35 Evidence:T32
T36	Span 61 155	Since GacS was found to be phosphorylated in a BfiS-dependent manner following 8 hrs of growth
T37	Causality 1591 1618	These findings suggest that
E9	Causality:T37 Effect:T38 Evidence:T35
T38	Span 1619 1746	GacS may play a dual role in regulating biofilm formation, which in turn may be dependent on the phosphorylation status of GacS
