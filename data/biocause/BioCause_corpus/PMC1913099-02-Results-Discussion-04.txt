Phage-Encoded Genes 
SF370 contains one inducible prophage (370.1) and three defective prophages (370.2, 370.3, and 370.4) that produce no infectious phage [39].
We identified 11 differentially expressed phage 370.2 genes, suggesting that this defective phage is not transcriptionally silent (Table 1).
The speH gene (spy1008) was induced, and the remaining genes, hypothetically involved in replication and regulation [39], were downregulated.
The speH gene encodes a mitogenic exotoxin [38] reportedly induced during polymorphonuclear leukocyte phagocytosis [8] but not implicated previously in adherence.
