M1	Negation E12
T36	Span 119 298	Previous work demonstrated that Salmonella mutants that were unable to survive within elicited peritoneal macrophages were attenuated for virulence during systemic mouse infection
T37	Causality 305 312	In fact
E13	Causality:T37 Effect:T38 Evidence:T36
T38	Span 314 490	fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of infected blood and spleen using Salmonella that expresses green fluorescent protein does not identify any extracellular bacteria
T39	Span 507 649	Salmonella is within blood monocytes and in other WBC in the spleen including neutrophils, dendritic cells, and B and T cells in these reports
T40	Causality 658 677	It is possible that
E14	Causality:T40 Evidence:T41 Effect:T39
T41	Span 678 818	growth in cells types other than macrophages is necessary for Salmonella to cause a systemic infection in mice following i.p. administration
T42	Causality 820 824	Thus
E15	Causality:T42 Effect:T43 Evidence:T41
T43	Span 826 929	some of the regulatory mutations described here may affect growth in cells types other than macrophages
E16	Causality:T42 Effect:T43 Evidence:T39
T44	Span 1636 1749	Even at the shortest time few intracellular bacteria were recovered from macrophage infection with an rpoE mutant
T45	Causality 1751 1766	suggesting that
E17	Causality:T45 Effect:T46 Evidence:T44
T46	Span 1767 1907	this strain is very sensitive to microbicidal factors released by macrophages on contact with bacteria or doesn't get internalized very well
T47	Causality 2943 2979	These results also demonstrated that
E18	Causality:T47 Effect:T48 Evidence:T49
T48	Span 2980 3179	growth in macrophages per se does not duplicate in vivo infection and that some regulator mutants that were totally avirulent in the mouse showed no differences in growth in these primary macrophages
T49	Span 2786 2930	Mutations of himD, rpoE, crp, or hfq drastically reduce the number of viable bacteria that can be recovered from macrophages even at short times
