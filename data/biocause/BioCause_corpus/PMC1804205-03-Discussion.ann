T95	Causality 156 168	resulting in
E20	Causality:T95 Cause:T96 Effect:T97
T96	Fact 37 154	the sensor kinase PmrB is the primary sensor that activates the PmrA protein when Salmonella experiences mild acid pH
T97	Fact 169 206	transcription of PmrA-activated genes
T98	Causality 269 284	is supported by
E21	Causality:T98 Effect:T99 Evidence:T100
T99	Span 222 268	PmrB is likely to sense changes in pH directly
T100	Span 305 424	the mild acid pH-dependent activation of the PmrA-regulated gene pbgP was dramatically reduced in a strain lacking pmrB
T101	Span 440 534	the periplasmic domain of PmrB was necessary for activation of pbgP under mild acid conditions
T102	Span 555 742	single amino acid substitutions in conserved histidine and glutamic acid residues located in the periplasmic domain of PmrB abolished its ability to stimulate pbgP transcription at pH 5.8
T103	Span 1007 1106	The requirement of periplasmic PmrB residues in the mild acid pH activation of PmrA-regulated genes
T104	Causality 1107 1120	suggests that
E22	Causality:T104 Effect:T105 Evidence:T103
T105	Span 1121 1187	this signalling pathway responds to changes in extracytoplasmic pH
T106	Span 2535 2671	In the case of PmrB, a normal response to mild acid pH requires not only a periplasmic histidine but also several glutamic acid residues
T107	Causality 2673 2682	Therefore
E23	Causality:T107 Cause:T106 Effect:T108
T108	Span 2684 2771	regulation of PmrB activity may involve protonation of one or more of these amino acids
T109	Span 3000 3117	the pKa of one of the glutamic acid residues of the regulatory protein TraM is approximately7.7 in the folded protein
T110	Causality 3137 3168	Therefore, it is plausible that
E24	Causality:T110 Evidence:T109 Effect:T111
T111	Span 3169 3300	protonation/deprotonation of one or more of the glutamic acids in the periplasmic domain of PmrB could occur at pH approximately5.8
T112	Span 3697 3859	the PmrB H35A and the E64A mutant proteins displayed partial activity in response to ferric iron but were severely impaired in their ability to respond to acid pH
T113	Causality 3884 3892	supports
E25	Causality:T113 Effect:T114 Evidence:T112
T114	Span 3909 3947	these signals are sensed independently
T118	Span 4453 4625	The levels of phosphorylated PmrA are determined by the balance of the autokinase + phosphotransferase activity of PmrB and PmrB's phosphatase activity towards phospho-PmrA
T119	Causality 4627 4631	Thus
E27	Causality:T119 Evidence:T118 Effect:T120
T120	Span 4633 4759	PmrD may be necessary to ensure that the amount of phosphorylated PmrA is such to promote transcription of its regulated genes
T121	Span 6392 6471	the low pH signal may also act synergistically with the low Mg2+ signal in vivo
T122	Causality 6472 6479	because
E28	Causality:T122 Effect:T121 Evidence:T123
T123	Span 6480 6608	Mg2+ deprivation alone is not sufficient to provide all the LPS modifications seen in Salmonella when present inside macrophages
E29	Causality:T98 Effect:T99 Evidence:T101
E30	Causality:T98 Effect:T99 Evidence:T102
