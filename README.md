# CREST: A Causal Relation Schema for Text :rocket:

CREST is a machine-readable format/schema that is created to help researchers who work on causal/counterfactual relation extraction and commonsense causal reasoning, to use and leverage the scattered data resources around these topics more easily. CREST-formatted data are stored as pandas [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html).

### How to convert dataset(s) to CREST:
* Clone this repository and go to the `/CREST` directory.
* Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Download spaCy's model: `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`
* Run the [`/crest/convert.py`](https://github.com/phosseini/CREST/blob/master/crest/convert.py):
     * `python convert.py -i`: printing the full list of currently supported datasets
     * `python convert.py [DATASET_ID_0] ... [DATASET_ID_n] [OUTPUT_FILE_NAME]`
          * `DATASET_ID_*`: id of a dataset.
          * `OUTPUT_FILE_NAME`: name of the output file that should be in `.xlsx` format
 * **Examples:**
     * Converting datasets `1` and `2`: `python convert.py 1 2 output.xlsx`
     * Converting dataset `5`: `python convert.py 5 output.xlsx`

### `CREST` format
Each relation in a CREST-formatted DataFrame has the following fields/values:
* **`original_id`**: the id of a relation in the original dataset, if such an id exists.
* **`span1`**: a list of strings of the first span/argument of the relation.
* **`span2`**: a list of strings of the second span/argument of the relation
* **`signal`**: a list of strings of signals/markers of the relation in context, if any.
* **`context`**: a text string of the context in which the relation appears.
* **`idx`**: a dictionary in the form of `{'span1': [], 'span2': [], 'signal': []}` to store indexes of span1, span2, and signal in context. Each value in the idx dictionary is a list of lists of start and end indexes of spans and the signal. For example, if span1 has multi tokens in context with `start:end` indexes 2:5 and 10:13, respectively, span1's value in `idx` will be `[[2, 5], [10, 13]]`. Lists are sorted based on the start indexes of tokens.
* **`label`**: label of the relation, `0: non-causal`, `1: causal`
* **`direction`**: direction between span1 and span2. `0: span1 => span2`, `1: span1 <= span2`, `-1: not-specified`
* **`source`**: id of the source dataset (`ids` are listed in a table below)
* **`split`**: `0: train`, `1: dev`, `2: test`. This is the split to which the relation belongs in the original dataset. If there is no split specified for a relation in the original dataset, we assign the relation to the `train` split by default.

**Note:** The reason we save a list of strings instead of a single string for span1, span2, and signal is that these text spans may contain multiple non-consecutive sub-spans in context.


### `CREST` conversion
We provide helper methods to convert CREST-formatted data to popular formats and annotation schemes, mainly formats that are used across relation extraction/classification tasks. In the following, there is a list of formats for which we have already developed CREST converter methods:
* `brat`: we have provided helper methods for two-way conversion of CREST data frames to brat (see example [here](https://github.com/phosseini/CREST/blob/master/notebooks/crest_brat.ipynb)). [brat](https://brat.nlplab.org/) is a popular web-based annotation tool that has been used for a variety of relation extraction NLP tasks. We use brat for two main reasons: 1) better visualization of causal and non-causal relations and their arguments, and 2) modifying annotations if needed and adding new annotations to provided context. In the following, there is a sample of a converted version of CREST-formatted relation to brat (example is taken from CaTeRS dataset):
           <p align="center">
           <img src='data/crest_brat_example.png' width='700' height='150' style="vertical-align:middle;margin:100px 50px">
           </p>
* `TACRED`: [TACRED](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/tacred/) is a large-scale relation extraction dataset. We convert samples from CREST to TACRED since TACRED-formatted data can be easily used as input to many transformers-based language models.
